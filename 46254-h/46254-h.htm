<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>"<cite>All the labor of <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'man s for'">man is for</span> his mouth,</cite>" says Solomon. If this
proverb be understood, as it was undoubtedly meant&mdash;that the chief
aim and purpose of all human labor are to make the homes of mankind
places of enjoyment, we see how important the art of household management
becomes.</p>

<p>While preparing my "New Cook Book," I was naturally led to examine
the subject, and the result was a deep conviction of the need of
another work on domestic economy, or directions how to guide the
house. This led me to prepare the present treatise, embodying rules
and receipts, such as never before have been brought together for the
help and instruction of a household.</p>

<p>"<em>Knowledge is power</em>" always; knowledge used for good purposes is
wisdom. Knowledge, like gold, must be gained by personal effort; and
usually, in small quantities, and by continued exertions, both wisdom and
gold are accumulated.</p>

<p>It has been by washing the sands of common experience and gathering
the small bits of science and art found here and there on the mining
ground of common knowledge, that this large work, containing the pure
gold of truth, applicable to all the needs of common life, has been
made. A few <em>nuggets</em> will be seen, such as the collected maxims of
Franklin, and the "Words of Washington," never before placed within
the reach of the popular mind.</p>

<p>In the economy and well-being of the family, personally and individually,
improvement should be sedulously kept in view. It is not
enough that woman understands the art of cookery and of managing
her house: she must also take care of herself; of children; of all who
will be dependent on her for direction, for health, for happiness.</p>

<p>Personal appearance is important; the art of beautifying a home is
important; the knowledge of ways and means by which the clothing of
a family may be kept in good order, with the least expense of time and
money, is important; some knowledge of plants, flowers, gardening,
and of domestic animals, is of much benefit, particularly to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
live in the country; and more important than all, is a knowledge of the
best means of preserving or restoring health. Then there is the very
important matter of home happiness to be kept in view. Amusements,
accomplishments, elegant arts, manners, modes of conduct in society;
all these are necessary knowledge. And to crown the whole, those indispensable
rules and maxims of moral improvement, which are the
foundation of good in the character and life of rational, immortal beings,
must be made familiar. All this has been attempted in "Receipts for
the Million," as every person may see by examining "The Table of
Contents" and the "Index."</p>

<p>The aim of both my works on domestic matters has been to awaken
the attention of my own sex to these subjects, belonging, so unquestionably,
to woman's department. <em>The home administration</em> is in her hands;
how salutary and powerful this may be made in its influence on humanity
is yet hardly imagined, even by the most sagacious and earnest advocates
of woman's elevation.</p>

<p>Would that those of my sex who are urging onward, into the industrial
pursuits, and other professions appropriate for men, might turn their
attention to improvements in domestic economy. Here is an open field,
where their heads and hearts as well as hands may find ample scope and
noble objects. The really great woman never undervalues her own
sphere. Madame Roland excelled in her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</i>; Mrs. Somerville is
eminent for domestic qualities; Mrs. Sigourney is a pattern housekeeper;
and a multitude of other names and examples may be met with in my
recent work,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> where genius is found adorning home pursuits.</p>

<p>There should be Lectures on Housekeeping, and other subjects connected
with domestic life, instituted in every Ladies Seminary. This
would serve to remedy, in some degree, the evils that now attend a boarding-school
education. The grand defect of this is, that teachers too often
leave out of sight the application of learning to the home pursuits of
young ladies. So when these return to the parental roof, they give
themselves up to novel reading, as their chief mental resource.</p>

<p>A better time is coming. Women, capable of using their faculties for
the improvement of society, will not much longer remain in the castle of
indolence. Miss Nightingale will find followers. And as the active pursuits
of women will naturally centre in the domestic circle, great advances
in the art of making home the place of happiness must be made.</p>

<p>May this book help onward the good work.</p>

<h3>HOME AND ITS EMPLOYMENTS.</h3>

<p class="hsumm"><em>House cleaning&mdash;Repairing Furniture&mdash;Washing&mdash;Mending
Glass, China, &amp;c.&mdash;Dyeing&mdash;Blacking for Boots, Shoes, &amp;c.&mdash;To
destroy Insects&mdash;The Kitchen, &amp;c.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1. <em>House Cleaning.</em>&mdash;The spring is more particularly the time
for house-cleaning; though, of course, it requires attention
monthly.</p>

<p>Begin at the top of the house; first take up the carpets, and,
if they require it, let them be scoured; or as carpets are sometimes
injured by scouring, they may be well beaten, and if
necessary, washed with soda and water.</p>

<p>Remove all the furniture from the room, have the chimneys
swept where fires have been kept, and clean and blacken the
grates. Wrap old towels, (they should be clean), around the
bristles of the broom, and sweep lightly the ceiling and paper;
or, if requisite, the paper should be cleaned with bread, as elsewhere
directed. Then wash the paint with a flannel or sponge,
and soap and water, and, as fast as one person cleans, another
should follow, and with clean cloths, wipe the paint perfectly
dry. Let the windows be cleaned, and scour the floor. Let
the furniture be well rubbed; and the floor being dry, and the
carpets laid down, the furniture may be replaced. The paper
should be swept every three months.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2. <em>To clean Bed-rooms.</em>&mdash;In cleaning bed-rooms infested with
bugs, take the bedsteads asunder, and wash every part of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
but especially the joints, with a strong solution of corrosive
sublimate in spirits of turpentine; as the sublimate is a fatal
poison, the bottle containing the above solution should be labelled
"Poison;" it should be used very carefully, and laid on
with a brush kept for the purpose. Bugs can only be removed
from walls by taking down the paper, washing them with the
above poison, and re-papering.</p>

<p>In bed-rooms with fires, a whisk-brush is best to clear the
curtains and hangings from dust.</p>

<p>To remove grease or oil from boards, drop on the spots spirits
of turpentine before the floor is scoured.</p>

<p>The house-maid should be provided with a box, with divisions,
to convey her various utensils, as brushes, black lead, &amp;c., from
room to room, and a small mat to kneel upon while cleaning
the grate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3. <em>Scouring Bed-rooms.</em>&mdash;This should never be done in winter
if it can be avoided, as it is productive of many coughs and
colds. If inevitable, a dry day should be selected, and the
windows and doors should be left wide open till dusk. A fire
ought always to be made in the room after cleaning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4. <em>To clean Carpets.</em>&mdash;Before sweeping a carpet, sprinkle over
it a few handfuls of waste tea-leaves. A stiff hair-broom or
brush should be used, unless the carpet be very dirty, when a
whisk or carpet-broom should be used first, followed by another
made of hair to take off the loose dirt. The frequent use of a
stiff broom soon injures the beauty of the best carpet. An ordinary
clothes-brush is best adapted for superior carpets.</p>

<p>When Brussels carpets are very much soiled, take them up
and beat them perfectly free from dust. Have the floor thoroughly
scoured and dry, and nail the carpet firmly down to it.
If still soiled, take a pailful of clean, cold water, and put into it
about three gills of ox-gall. Take another pail, with clean, cold
water only; now rub with a soft scrubbing-brush some of the
ox-gall water on the carpet, which will raise a lather. When a
convenient-sized portion is done, wash the lather off with a clean
linen cloth dipped in the clean water. Let this water be changed
frequently. When all the lather has disappeared, rub the part
with a clean, dry cloth. After all is done, open the window to
allow the carpet to dry. A carpet treated in this manner, will be
greatly refreshed in color, particularly the greens. Kidderminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
carpets will scarcely bear the above treatment without becoming
so soft as speedily to become dirty again. This may,
in some measure, be prevented by brushing them over with a
hot, weak solution of size in water, to which a little alum has
been added. Curd soap dissolved in hot water, may be used
instead of ox-gall, but it is more likely to injure the colors, if
produced by false dyes. Where there are spots of grease in
the carpeting, they may be covered with curd soap dissolved in
boiling water, and rubbed with a brush until the stains are removed,
when they must be cleaned with warm water as before.
The addition of a little gall to the soap renders it more efficacious.</p>

<p>The carpets should be nailed on the full stretch, else they will
shrink.</p>

<p>Fullers' earth is also used for cleaning carpets; and alum, or
soda, dissolved in water, for reviving the colors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>5. <em>To clean Turkey Carpets.</em>&mdash;To revive the color of a Turkey
carpet, beat it well with a stick till the dust is all got out; then,
with a lemon or sorrel juice, take out the spots of ink, if the
carpet be stained with any; wash it in cold water, and afterwards
shake out all the water from the threads of the carpet.
When it is thoroughly dry, rub it all over with the crumb of a
hot wheaten loaf; and, if the weather is very fine, hang it out
in the open air a night or two.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>6. <em>Cheap Carpeting.</em>&mdash;Sew together strips of the cheapest
cotton cloth, of the size of the room, and tack the edges to the
floor. Then paper the cloth, as you would the sides of a room,
with any sort of room paper. After being well dried, give it
two coats of varnish, and your carpet is finished. It can be
washed like carpets, without injury, retains its gloss, and, on
chambers or sleeping rooms, where it will not meet rough usage,
will last for two years, as good as new.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>7. <em>To beat a Carpet.</em>&mdash;Hang the carpet upon a clothes-line,
or upon a stout line between two trees; it should then be beaten
on the <em>wrong side</em>, by three or four persons, each having a pliable
stick, with cloth tied strongly in a knob on the end, in order to
prevent the carpet from being torn, or the seams split, by the
sharp end of the stick. When thoroughly beaten on the wrong
side, the carpet should be turned, and beaten on the right side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>8. <em>Floor or Oil Cloths.</em>&mdash;Floor-cloths should be chosen that
are painted on a fine cloth, which is well covered with the color,
and the patterns on which do not rise much above the ground,
as they wear out first. The durability of the cloth will depend
much on these particulars, but more especially on the time it
has been painted, and the goodness of the colors. If they have
not been allowed sufficient time for becoming thoroughly hardened,
a very little use will injure them; and, as they are very
expensive articles, care in preserving them is necessary. It
answers to keep them some time before they are used, either
hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down
in a spare room.</p>

<p>When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round a
carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning the
edges in too suddenly.</p>

<p>Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and seasoned
some months before laid down. If for passages, the width must
be directed when they are sent to the manufactory, as they are
cut before painting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>9. <em>To clean Floor cloths.</em>&mdash;Sweep, then wipe them with a flannel;
and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a
waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one; but use little
wax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little smoothness,
or it may endanger falling.</p>

<p>Washing now and then with milk, after the above sweeping
and dry-rubbing them, gives as beautiful a look, and they are
less slippery.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>10. <em>Method of Cleaning Paper-hangings.</em>&mdash;Cut into eight
half quarters a large loaf, two days old; it must neither be
newer nor staler. With one of these pieces, after having blown
off all the dust from the paper to be cleaned, by means of a
good pair of bellows, begin at the top of the room, holding the
crust in the hand, and wiping lightly downward with the crumb,
about half a yard at each stroke, till the upper part of the
hangings is completely cleaned all round. Then go round again,
with the like sweeping stroke downwards, always commencing
each successive course a little higher than the upper stroke had
extended, till the bottom be finished. This operation, if carefully
performed, will frequently make very old paper look almost
equal to new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Great caution must be used not by any means to rub the
paper hard, nor to attempt cleaning it the cross, or horizontal
way. The dirty part of the bread, too, must be each time cut
away, and the pieces renewed as soon as it may become necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>11. <em>To clean Paint.</em>&mdash;Never use a cloth, but take off the dust
with a little long-haired brush, after blowing off the loose parts
with the bellows. With care, paint will look well for a long
time, if guarded from the influence of the sun. When soiled,
dip a sponge or a bit of flannel into soda and water, wash it off
quickly, and dry immediately, or the soda will eat off the color.
Some persons use strong soap and water, instead.</p>

<p>When the wainscot requires scouring, it should be done from
the top downwards, and the water be prevented from running
on the unclean parts as much as possible, or marks will be made
which will appear after the whole is finished. One person
should dry with old linen, as fast as the other has scoured off
the dirt, and washed off the soap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>12. <em>To give to Boards a beautiful appearance.</em>&mdash;After washing
them very nicely with soda and warm water and a brush, wash
them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times
observe to leave no spot untouched; and clean straight up and
down, not crossing from board to board; then dry with clean
cloths, rubbed hard up and down in the same way.</p>

<p>The floors should not be often wetted, but very thoroughly
when done; and once a-week dry-rubbed with hot sand and a
heavy brush the right way of the boards.</p>

<p>The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets or floor-cloths,
should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel,
and the edges will not be soiled. Different sponges should be
kept for the above two uses; and those and the brushes should
be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Item number missing; 12a inserted">12a.</span> <em>To extract Oil from Boards or Stone.</em>&mdash;Make a strong ley of
pearlashes and soft water, and add as much unslaked lime as
it will take up; stir it together, and then let it settle a few
minutes; bottle it, and stop close; have ready some water to
lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor
should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the color of them;
therefore do it with care and expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>13. <em>To scour Boards.</em>&mdash;Mix together one part lime, three
parts common sand, and two parts soft soap; lay a little of this
on the scrubbing-brush, and rub the board thoroughly. Afterwards
rinse with clean water, and dry with a clean coarse cloth.
This will keep the boards a good color: it is also useful in keeping
away vermin. For that object, early in the spring, beds
should be taken down, and furniture in general removed and
examined; bed-hangings and window-curtains, if not washed,
should be shaken and brushed; and the joints of bedsteads, the
backs of drawers, and indeed, every part of furniture, except
polished mahogany, should be carefully cleaned with the above
mixture, or with equal parts of lime and soft soap, without any
sand. In old houses, where there are holes in the boards, which
often abound with vermin, after scrubbing in, as far as the brush
can reach, a thick plaster of the above should be spread over
the holes, and covered with paper. When these things are timely
attended to, and combined with general cleanliness, vermin
may generally be kept away, even in crowded cities.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>14. <em>To wash Stone Stairs and Halls.</em>&mdash;Wash them first with
hot water and a clean flannel, and then wash them over with
pipe-clay mixed in water. When dry, rub them, with a coarse
flannel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>15. <em>To take Oil and Grease out of Floors and Stone Halls.</em>&mdash;Make
a strong infusion of potash with boiling water; add to
it as much quick-lime as will make it of the consistence of
thick cream; let it stand a night, then pour off the clear part,
which is to be bottled for use. When wanted, warm a little of
it; pour it upon the spots, and after it has been on them for a
few minutes, scour it off with warm water and soap, as it is
apt to discolor the boards when left too long on them. When
put upon stone, it is best to let it remain all night; and if the
stain be a bad one, a little powdered hot lime may be put upon
it before the infusion is poured on.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>16. <em>To clean Marble.</em>&mdash;Muriatic acid, either diluted or pure,
as occasion may require, proves efficacious. If too strong, it
will deprive the marble of its polish, which may be easily restored
by the use of a piece of felt, with some powder of putty
or tripoli, with either, making use of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>17. <em>To clean Marble. Another way.</em>&mdash;Mix ¼ lb. of soft soap
with the same of pounded whiting, 1 oz. of soda, and a piece
of stone-blue the size of a walnut; boil these together for ¼ of
an hour; whilst hot, rub it over the marble with a piece of
flannel, and leave it on for 24 hours; then wash it off with clean
water, and polish the marble with a piece of coarse flannel, or
what is better, a piece of an old hat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>18. <em>To take Stains out of Marble.</em>&mdash;Mix unslaked lime
in finest powder with stringent soap-ley, pretty thick, and instantly
with a painter's brush lay it on the whole of the marble.
In two months' time wash it off perfectly clean; then have
ready a fine thick lather of soft soap, boiled in soft water; dip
a brush in it, and scour the marble. This will, with very good
rubbing, give a beautiful polish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>19. <em>To take Iron-stains out of Marble.</em>&mdash;An equal quantity
of fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon-juice being mixed in a bottle,
shake it well; wet the spots, and in a few minutes rub with
soft linen till they disappear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>20. <em>Mixture for cleaning Stone Stairs, Hall Pavements, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Boil
together half a pint each of size and stone-blue water,
with two table-spoonfuls of whiting, and two cakes of pipe-makers'
clay, in about two quarts of water. Wash the stones
over with a flannel slightly wetted in this mixture; and when
dry, rub them with flannel and a brush. Some persons recommend
beer, but water is much better for the purpose.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>21. <em>To Color or Paper the Walls of Rooms.</em>&mdash;If a ceiling or
wall is to be whitewashed or colored, the first thing to be done is,
to wash off the dirt and stains with a brush and clean water, being
careful to move the brush in one direction, up and down, and
not all sorts of ways, or the work will look smeary afterwards.
When dry, the ceiling is ready for whitewash, which is to be
made by mixing whiting and water together, till quite smooth,
and as thick as cream. Dissolve half-an-ounce of glue in a teacupful
of water, stir it into the whitewash. This <em>size</em>, as it is
called, prevents the white or color rubbing off the wall, and a
teacupful is enough for a gallon of wash. Stone color is made
by mixing a little yellow ochre and blue black with the size, and
then stirring it into the whitewash; yellow or red ochre are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
good colors, and, with vermilion or indigo, any shade may be
prepared, according to taste.</p>

<p>If paper is to be used, the wall must be washed with clean
water, as above explained; and while wet, the old color must
be scraped off with a knife, or a smooth-edged steel scraper of
any sort. It will be best to wet a yard or two at a time, and
then scrape. Next, wash the wall all over with size, made with
an ounce of glue to a gallon of water; and when this is dry,
the wall is ready for the paper. This must be cut into lengths
according to the different parts of the room; one edge of the
plain strip must be cut off close to the pattern, and the other
left half an inch wide. If the paper is thick, it should lie a
minute or two after it is pasted; but if thin, the sooner it is on
the wall, the better. Begin by placing the close-cut edge of the
paper at one side of the window, stick it securely to meet the
ceiling, let it hang straight, and then press it down lightly and
regularly with a clean cloth. The close-cut edge of the next
length will cover the half-inch left on the first one, and so make
a neat join; and in this way you may go all round the room,
and finish at the other side of the window.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>22. <em>Damp Walls.</em>&mdash;Damp may be prevented from exuding
from walls by first drying them thoroughly, and then covering
them with the following mixture: In a quart of linseed oil, boil
three ounces of litharge, and four ounces of resin. Apply this
in successive coats, and it will form a hard varnish on the wall
after the fifth coating.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>23. <em>To clean Moreen Curtains.</em>&mdash;Having removed the dust
and clinging dirt as much as possible with a brush, lay the curtain
on a large table, sprinkle on it a little bran, and rub it
round with a piece of clean flannel; when the bran and flannel
become soiled, use fresh, and continue rubbing till the moreen
looks bright, which it will do in a short time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>24. <em>To clean Calico Furniture.</em>&mdash;Shake off the loose dust;
then lightly brush with a small, long-haired furniture-brush;
after which wipe it closely with clean flannels, and rub it with
dry bread.</p>

<p>If properly done, the curtains will look nearly as well as at
first; and, if the color be not light, they will not require washing
for years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Fold in large parcels, and put carefully by.</p>

<p>While the furniture remains up, it should be preserved from
the sun and air as much as possible, which injure delicate colors;
and the dust may be blown off with bellows.</p>

<p>By the above mode curtains may be kept clean, even to use
with the linings newly dipped.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>25. <em>Making Beds.</em>&mdash;Close or press bedsteads are ill adapted
for young persons or invalids; when their use is unavoidable,
the bed-clothes should be displaced every morning, and left for
a short time before they are shut up.</p>

<p>The windows of bed-rooms should be kept open for some
hours every day, to carry off the effluvia from the bed-clothes;
the bed should also be shaken up, and the clothes spread about,
in which state the longer they remain, the better.</p>

<p>The bed being made, the clothes should not be tucked in at
the sides or foot, as that prevents any further purification taking
place, by the cool air passing through them.</p>

<p>A warming-pan should be chosen without holes in the lid.
About a yard of moderately-sized iron chain, made red hot and
put into the pan, is a simple and excellent substitute for coals.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>26. <em>To Detect Dampness in Beds.</em>&mdash;Let the bed be well
warmed, and immediately after the warming-pan is taken out,
introduce between the sheets, in an inverted position, a clean
glass goblet: after it has remained in that situation a few minutes,
examine it; if found dry and not tarnished with steam,
the bed is perfectly safe; and <em>vice versa</em>. In the latter case, it
will be best to sleep between the blankets.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>27. <em>Beech-tree Leaves.</em>&mdash;The leaves of the beech-tree, collected
at autumn, in dry weather, form an admirable article for
filling beds for the poor. The smell is grateful and wholesome;
they do not harbor vermin, are very elastic, and may be replenished
annually without cost.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>28. <em>Useful Hints relative to Bed-clothes, Mattresses, Cushions,
&amp;c.</em>&mdash;The purity of feathers and wool employed for mattresses
and cushions ought to be considered as a first object of salubrity.
Animal emanations may, under many circumstances, be
prejudicial to the health; but the danger is still greater, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the wool is impregnated with sweat of persons who have experienced
putrid and contagious diseases. Bed-clothes, and the
wool of mattresses, therefore, cannot be too often beat, carded,
cleaned, and washed. This is a caution which cannot be too
often recommended.</p>

<p>It would be very easy in most situations, and very effectual,
to fumigate them with muriatic gas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>29. <em>To clean Feathers of their Oil.</em>&mdash;In each gallon of clean
water mix a pound of quick-lime, and when the undissolved lime
settles in fine powder, pour off the lime-water for use. Having
put the feathers to be cleaned into a tub, pour the clear lime-water
upon them, and stir them well about; let them remain
three or four days in the lime-water, which should then be separated
from them by laying them in a sieve. The feathers should
next be washed in clean water, and dried upon fine nets; they
will then only require beating, to get rid of the dust, previous
to use.</p>

<p>To restore the spring of damaged feathers, it is only necessary
to dip them in warm water for a short time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>30. <em>To purify Wool infested with Insects.</em>&mdash;The process of
purification consists in putting into three pints of boiling water
a pound and a half of alum, and as much cream of tartar, which
are diluted in twenty-three pints more of cold water. The wool
is then left immersed in this liquor during some days, after
which it is washed and dried. After this operation, it will no
longer be subject to be attacked by insects.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>31. <em>To clean Looking-glasses.</em>&mdash;Keep for this purpose a piece
of sponge, a cloth, and a silk handkerchief, all entirely free from
dirt, as the least grit will scratch the fine surface of the glass.
First, sponge it with a little spirit of wine, or gin and water,
so as to clean off all spots; then, dust over it powder-blue, tied
in muslin, rub it lightly and quickly off with the cloth, and finish
by rubbing it with the silk handkerchief. Be careful not to
rub the edges of the frames.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>32. <em>To preserve Gilding, and clean it.</em>&mdash;It is impossible to prevent
flies from staining the gilding without covering it; before
which, blow off the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
over it, but never touch it with water; then, with strips of paper,
or rather gauze, cover the frames of your glasses, and do
not remove till the flies are gone.</p>

<p>Linen takes off the gilding and deadens its brightness; it
should, therefore, never be used for wiping it.</p>

<p>A good preventive against flies is, to boil three or four leeks
in a pint of water, and then with a gilding-brush wash over the
glasses and frames with the liquid, and the flies will not go near
the articles so washed. This will not injure the frames in the
least. Stains or spots may be removed by gently wiping them
with cotton dipped in sweet oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>33. <em>To retouch the rubbed parts of a Picture-frame.</em>&mdash;Give the
wood a coating of size made by dissolving isinglass with a weak
spirit. When nearly dry, lay on some gold leaf; and polish,
when quite dry, with an agate burnisher, or any similar
substance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>34. <em>Furniture Oil.</em>&mdash;Put into a jar one pint of linseed oil
into which stir one ounce of powdered rose pink, and one ounce
of alkanet root, beaten in a mortar: set the jar in a warm place
for a few days, when the oil will be deeply colored, and the
substances having settled, the oil may be poured off, and will
be excellent for darkening new mahogany.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>35. <em>Furniture Paste.</em>&mdash;Put turpentine into a glazed pot, and
scrape beeswax into it, which stir about till the liquid is of the
thickness of cream; it will then be good for months, if kept
clean; and furniture cleaned with the liquid thus made, will not
receive stains so readily as when the turpentine and wax are
heated over the fire; which plan is, besides, very dangerous;
but if the heating be preferred, place the vessel containing the
wax and turpentine in another containing boiling water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>36. <em>French Polish for Furniture.</em>&mdash;To one pint of spirits of
wine, add half an ounce of gum-shellac, half an ounce of gum-lac,
a quarter of an ounce of gum-sandarac; place the whole
in a gentle heat, frequently shaking it, till the gums are dissolved,
when it is fit for use. Make a roller of list, put a little of the
polish upon it, and cover that with a piece of soft linen rag,
which must be lightly touched with cold-drawn linseed oil.
Rub the wood in a circular direction, not covering too large a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
space at a time, till the pores of the wood are sufficiently filled
up. After this, rub in the same manner spirits of wine, with
a small portion of the polish added to it; and a most brilliant
polish will be produced. If the article should have been polished
with wax, it will be necessary to clean it off with fine
glass paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>37. <em>Another Polish and Varnish.</em>&mdash;The only way to preserve
polish on rosewood French-polished furniture, is to keep it continually
rubbed with a chamois leather and a silk handkerchief.
We have no better remedy to offer for scratches on the wood
than filling them in with a little oil covered with alkanet-root.
The following varnish for furniture not French-polished, has
been highly recommended: Melt one part of virgin white wax
with eight parts of petroleum; lay a slight coat of this mixture
on the wood with a fine brush while warm; the oil will then
evaporate, and leave a thin coat of wax, which should afterwards
be polished with a coarse woolen cloth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>38. <em>Polish for Dining Tables.</em>&mdash;Is to rub them with cold-drawn
linseed oil, thus: Put a little in the middle of a table,
and then with a piece of linen (never use woolen) cloth rub it
well all over the table; then take another piece of linen and
rub it for ten minutes, then rub it till quite dry with another
cloth. This must be done every day for some months, when
you will find your mahogany acquire a permanent and beautiful
lustre, unattainable by any other means, and equal to the
finest French polish; and if the table is covered with the table-cloth
only, the hottest dishes will make no impression upon it;
and when once this polish is produced, it will only require dry
rubbing with a linen cloth for about ten minutes, twice in a
week, to preserve it in the highest perfection; which never fails
to please your employers; and remember, that to please others
is always the surest way to profit yourself.</p>

<p>If the appearance must be more immediately produced, take
some <span class="smcap">Furniture Paste</span>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>39. <em>Varnished Furniture.</em>&mdash;This may be finished off so as to
look equal to the best French polished wood, in the following
manner, which is also suitable to other varnished surfaces.
Take two ounces of Tripoli powder, put it into an earthen pot,
with just enough water to cover it; then take a piece of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
flannel, lay it over a piece of cork or rubber, and proceed to polish
the varnish, always wetting it with the Tripoli and water. It
will be known when the process is finished by wiping a part of
the work with a sponge, and observing whether there is a fair,
even gloss. When this is the case, take a bit of mutton suet
and fine flour, and clean the work.</p>

<p>Frames of varnished wood may be cleaned to look new, by
careful washing with a sponge and soap and water, but nothing
stronger should be used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>40. <em>Varnish for Violins, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Take a gallon of rectified spirits
of wine, twelve ounces of mastic, and a pint of turpentine
varnish; put them all together in a tin can, and keep it in a very
warm place, shaking it occasionally till it is perfectly dissolved;
then strain it, and it is fit for use. If you find it necessary, you
may dilute it with turpentine varnish. This varnish is also
very useful for furniture of plum-tree, mahogany, or rosewood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>41. <em>White Varnish.</em>&mdash;The white varnish used for toys is made
of sandarac, eight ounces; mastic, two ounces; Canada balsam,
four ounces; alcohol, one quart. This is white, drying, and
capable of being polished when hard. Another varnish for objects
of the toilet, such as work-boxes, card-cases, &amp;c., is made
of gum sandarac, six ounces; elemi (genuine), four ounces:
anime, one ounce; camphor, half an ounce; rectified spirit, one
quart. Melt slowly. These ingredients may, of course, be lessened
in proportion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>42. <em>To remove Ink-spots from Mahogany.</em>&mdash;Drop on the spots
a very small quantity of spirits of salt; rub it with a feather
or piece of flannel, taking care not to let the spirit reach the fingers
or clothes; in four or five minutes, wash it off with water.</p>

<p>Or, mix a teaspoonful of burnt alum, powdered, with a quarter
of an ounce of oxalic acid, in half a pint of cold water; to
be used by wetting a rag with it, and rubbing it on the ink-spots.</p>

<p>Or, crumple a piece of blotting-paper, so as to make it
firm, wet it, and with it rub the ink-spot firmly and briskly,
when it will disappear; and the white mark from the operation
may be immediately removed by rubbing it with a cloth.</p>

<p>43. <em>Or:</em>&mdash;Dilute ½ a teaspoonful of oil of vitriol with a large
spoonful of water, and touch the part with a feather; watch it,
for if it stays too long, it will leave a white mark. It is, therefore,
better to rub it quickly, and repeat if not quite removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>44. <em>To clean Chairs.</em>&mdash;Scrape down one or two ounces of
beeswax, put it into a jar, and pour as much spirits of turpentine
over it as will cover it: let it stand till dissolved. Put a
little upon a flannel or bit of green baize, rub it upon the chairs,
and polish them with a brush. A very small portion of finely-powdered
white rosin may be mixed with the turpentine and
wax.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>45. <em>To clean and restore the Elasticity of Cane Chair Bottoms,
Couches, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Turn up the chair bottom, &amp;c., and with
hot water and a sponge wash the cane work well, so that it may
be well soaked; should it be dirty, you must add soap; let it
dry in the air, and you will find it as tight and firm as when
new, providing the cane is not broken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>46. <em>Blacking for Leather Seats, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Beat well the yolks of
two eggs, and the white of one; mix a tablespoonful of gin and
a teaspoonful of sugar, thicken it with ivory black, add it to the
eggs, and use as common blacking; the seats or cushions being
left a day or two to harden.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>47. <em>To prevent Hinges Creaking.</em>&mdash;Rub them with soft soap,
or a feather dipped in oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>48. <em>Swallows' Nests.</em>&mdash;To prevent swallows building under
eaves, or in window corners, rub the places with oil or soft soap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>49. <em>To clean Polished Grates and Irons.</em>&mdash;Make into a paste
with cold water, four pounds of putty-powder and one of finely-powdered
whiting; rub off carefully the spots from the irons,
and with a dry clean duster rub the irons with the mixture always
in the same direction till bright and clear. Plain dry
whiting will keep it highly polished if well attended to every
day. The putty mixture should be used only to remove spots.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>50. <em>To clean the Back of the Grate, the inner Hearth, and the
fronts of Cast-Iron Stoves.</em>&mdash;Mix black lead and whites of eggs
well beaten together; dip a painter's brush, and wet all over,
then rub it bright with a hard brush.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>51. <em>To remove the Black from the Bright Bars of Polished
Stoves in a few minutes.</em>&mdash;Rub them well with some of the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
mixture on a bit of broadcloth; when the dirt is removed,
wipe them clean, and polish with glass (not sand) paper.</p>

<p>52. <em>For Mixture</em>:&mdash;Boil slowly one pound of soft soap in two
quarts of water to one quart. Of this jelly take three or four
spoonfuls, and mix to a consistence with emery.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>53. <em>To clean Bright Stoves.</em>&mdash;There are many ways of cleaning
a stove, but if the ornamental parts be neglected, rust will
soon disfigure the surface, and lead to incalculable trouble.
Emery dust, moistened into a paste with sweet oil, should be
kept in a little jar; this should be applied on a bung, up and
down, never crossways, until marks or burns disappear. A
dry leather should then remove the oil, and a polish should afterwards
be given with putty powder on a dry clean leather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>54. <em>Another way to clean Grates.</em>&mdash;The best mixture for cleaning
bright stove-grates is rotten-stone and sweet oil: they require
constant attention, for, if rust be once suffered to make its appearance,
it will become a toil to efface it. Polished fire-irons,
if not allowed to rust by neglect, will require merely rubbing
with leather; and the higher the polish, the less likely they are
to rust. If the room be shut up for a time, and the grates be
not used, to prevent their rusting, cover them with lime and
sweet oil.</p>

<p>Bright fenders are cleaned as stoves; cast-iron fenders require
black lead; they should not, however, be cleaned in the sitting-room,
as the powdered lead may fly about and injure carpets
and furniture. A good plan is to send cast-iron fenders to be
bronzed or lackered by the iron-monger; they will then only
require brushing, to free the dust from the ornamental work.
The bright top of a fender should be cleaned with fine emery-paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>55. <em>To prevent Fire-Irons becoming Rusty.</em>&mdash;Rub them with
sweet oil, and dust over them unslaked lime. If they be rusty,
oil them for two or three days, then wipe them dry, and polish
with flour emery, powdered pumice-stone, or lime. A mixture
of tripoli with half its quantity of sulphur, will also remove
rust; as will emery mixed with soft soap, boiled to a jelly. The
last mixture is also used for removing the fire-marks from bright
bars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>56. <em>To Color the Backs of Chimneys with Lead Ore.</em>&mdash;Clean
them with a very strong brush, and carefully rub off the dust and
rust; pound about a quarter of a pound of lead ore into a fine
powder, and put it into a vessel with half a pint of vinegar,
then apply it to the back of the chimney with a brush. When
it is made black with this liquid, take a dry brush, dip it in the
same powder without vinegar; then dry and rub it with this
brush, till it becomes as shining as glass.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>57. <em>To blacken the fronts of Stone Chimney-pieces.</em>&mdash;Mix oil-varnish
with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to thin
it to the consistence of paint. Wash the stone with soap and
water very clean; then sponge it with clear water; and when
perfectly dry, brush it over twice with this color, letting it dry
between the times. It looks extremely well. The lamp-black
must be sifted first.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>58. <em>Composition that will effectually prevent Iron, Steel, &amp;c.,
from rusting.</em>&mdash;This method consists in mixing, with fat oil varnish,
four-fifths of well rectified spirit of turpentine. The varnish
is to be applied by means of a sponge; and articles varnished
in this manner will retain their metallic brilliancy, and never
contract any spots of rust. It may be applied to copper, and
to the preservation of philosophical instruments; which, by
being brought into contact with water, are liable to lose their
splendor, and become tarnished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>59. <em>To keep Arms and polished Metal from Rust.</em>&mdash;Dissolve
<span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'once ounce'">one ounce</span> of camphor in two pounds of hog's lard, observing
to take off the scum; then mix as much black lead as will give
the mixture an iron color. Fire-arms, &amp;c., rubbed over with
this mixture, and left with it on twenty-four hours, and then
dried with a linen cloth, will keep clean for many months.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>60. <em>To preserve Irons from Rust.</em>&mdash;Melt fresh mutton-suet,
and smear over the iron with it while hot; then dust it well with
unslaked lime pounded and tied up in a muslin. Irons so prepared
will keep many months. Use no oil for them but salad-oil,
there being water in all other.</p>

<p>Fire-irons should be wrapped in baize, and kept in a dry
place, when not used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>61. <em>To prevent polished Hardware and Cutlery from taking
Rust.</em>&mdash;Case-knives, snuffers, watch-chains, and other small articles
made of steel, may be preserved from rust, by being
carefully wiped after use, and then wrapped in coarse brown
paper, the virtue of which is such, that all hardware goods from
Sheffield, Birmingham, &amp;c., are always wrapped in the same.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>62. <em>Another way.</em>&mdash;Beat into three pounds of fresh hog's-lard
two drachms of camphor till it is dissolved; then add as much
black lead as will make it the color of broken steel. Dip a rag
in it, and rub it thick on the stove, &amp;c., and the steel will never
rust, even if wet. When it is to be used, the grease must be
washed off with hot water, and the steel be dried before polishing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>63. <em>To take Rust out of Steel.</em>&mdash;Cover the steel with sweet
oil well rubbed on it, and in forty-eight hours use unslaked lime
finely powdered, to rub until all the rust disappears.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>64. <em>To clean Plate.</em>&mdash;See that the plate is quite free from
grease, by having been washed, if necessary, in warm soap and
water. Then mix some whiting with water, and with a sponge
rub it well on the plate, which will take the tarnish off, making
use of a brush not too hard, to clean the intricate parts. Next,
take some rouge-powder, mix it with water to about the thickness
of cream, and with a small piece of leather (which should
be kept for that purpose only) apply the rouge. This, with a
little rubbing, will produce a most beautiful polish. This is the
actual manner in which silversmiths clean their plate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>65. <em>The common method of cleaning Plate.</em>&mdash;First wash it well
with soap and warm water; when perfectly dry, mix together a
little whiting and sweet oil, so as to make a soft paste; then
take a piece of flannel, rub it on the plate, then with a leather,
and plenty of dry whiting, rub it clean off again; then with a
clean leather and a brush, finish it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>66. <em>An easy way to clean Plate.</em>&mdash;A flannel and soap, and soft
water, with proper rubbing, will clean plate nicely. It should
be wiped dry with a good-sized piece of soft leather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>67. <em>Plate Powder.</em>&mdash;In most of the articles sold as plate powders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
under a variety of names, there is an injurious mixture of
quicksilver, which is said sometimes so far to penetrate and render
silver brittle, that it will even break with a fall. Whiting,
properly purified from sand, applied wet, and rubbed till dry, is
one of the easiest, safest, and certainly the cheapest of all plate
powders: jewelers and silversmiths, for small articles, seldom
use any thing else. If, however, the plate be boiled a little in
water, with an ounce of calcined hartshorn in powder to about
three pints of water, then drained over the vessel in which it
was boiled, and afterwards dried by the fire, while some soft linen
rags are boiled in the liquid till they have wholly imbibed it;
these rags will, when dry, not only assist to clean the plate,
which must afterwards be rubbed bright with leather, but also
serve admirably for cleaning brass locks, finger-plates, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>68. <em>To cleanse Gold.</em>&mdash;Wash the article in warm suds made
of delicate soap and water, with ten or fifteen drops of sal-volatile.
(The sal-volatile will render the metal brittle. This hint
may be used or left, at pleasure.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>69. <em>To clean Brass and Copper.</em>&mdash;Rub it over slightly with a
bit of flannel dipped in sweet oil; next, rub it hard with another
bit dipped in finely-powdered rotten stone; then make it clean
with a soft linen cloth, and finish by polishing it with a plate-leather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>70. <em>Obs.</em>&mdash;The inside of brass or copper vessels should be
scoured with fullers' earth and water, and set to dry, else the
tinning will be injured.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>71. <em>Another way to clean Brass and Copper.</em>&mdash;Put one pennyworth
of powdered rotten stone into a dry, clean quart bottle;
nearly fill it up with cold soft water; shake it well, and add one
penny-worth of vitriol. Rub it on with a rag, and dry it with
a clean, soft cloth, and then polish it with a plate-leather. This
mixture will keep for a long time, and becomes better the longer
it is kept. But the first method gives the most lasting polish,
as well as the finest color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>72. <em>To clean Brass Ornaments.</em>&mdash;Wash the ornament in a
strong solution of boiled roche-alum, in the proportion of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ounce to a pint of water. When dry, rub them with fine tripoli
powder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>73. <em>Polishing Paste for Britannia metal, tins, brasses, and
coppers</em>, is composed of rotten-stone, soft soap, and oil of turpentine.</p>

<p>The stone must be powdered and sifted through a muslin or
hair sieve: mix with it as much soft soap as will bring it to
the stiffness of putty: to about half-a-pound of this, add two ozs.
of oil of turpentine. It may be made up in balls, or put in gallipots;
it will soon become hard, and will keep any length of
time. Method of using:&mdash;The articles to be polished should be
perfectly freed from grease and dirt. Moisten a little of the
paste with water, smear it over the metal, then rub briskly
with dry rag or wash-leather, and it will soon bear a beautiful
polish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>74. <em>To clean Britannia metal.</em>&mdash;Rub the article with a piece
of flannel moistened with sweet oil; then apply a little pounded
rotten-stone or polishing paste with the finger, till the polish is
produced; then wash the article with soap and hot water, and
when dry, rub with soft wash-leather, and a little fine whiting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>75. <em>To clean Pewter.</em>&mdash;Scour it with fine white sand, and
strong ley made with wood-ashes, soda, or pearl-ash; then rinse
the pewter in clean water, and set it to drain. The best method,
however, is to use the oil of tartar and sand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>76. <em>To clean Tin Covers.</em>&mdash;Get the finest whiting; mix a little
of it powdered with the least drop of sweet oil, rub the covers
well with it, and wipe them clean; then dust over them some
dry whiting in a muslin bag, and rub bright with dry leather.
This last is to prevent rust, which the cook must guard against
by wiping them dry, and putting them by the fire when they
come from the parlor; for if but once hung up damp, the inside
will rust.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>77. <em>Safe Method of cleaning Tea-urns.</em>&mdash;In an earthen gallipot
put one ounce of bees'-wax, cut up in small pieces; set it by
the fireside, until perfectly melted and quite hot, very near boiling
heat; remove the jar from the fire, and stir into it rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
less than a table-spoonful of salad oil, and rather more than a
table-spoonful of best spirits of turpentine; continue stirring
till well mixed and nearly cold; fill the urn with boiling water
so as to make it thoroughly hot, apply a thin coating of the
above mixture, and rub with a soft cloth, till all stickiness is removed,
then polish with a clean rag and a little crocus powder.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;The crocus powder must be very fine, so as to sift
through muslin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>78. <em>To clean Gilt or Lacquered Articles.</em>&mdash;Brush them with
warm soap and water, wipe them, and set them before the fire
to dry; finish with a soft cloth. By this simple means may be
cleaned ormolu and French gilt candelabra, branches, and lamps;
mosaic gold and gilt jewelry, toys and ornaments. Care is requisite
in brushing the dirt from fine work, and finishing it quite
dry. Any thing stronger than soap, as acids, pearl-ash, or soda,
will be liable to remove the lacquer.</p>

<p><em>To polish inlaid Brass Ornaments.</em>&mdash;Mix powdered tripoli and
linseed oil, and dip in it a piece of hat, with which rub the brass;
then, if the wood be ebony, or dark rosewood, polish it with
elder ashes in fine powder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>79. <em>To clean Lacquer.</em>&mdash;Make a paste of starch, one part;
powdered rotten-stone, twelve parts; sweet oil, two parts; oxalic
acid, one part; water to mix.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>80. <em>To clean Door-plates.</em>&mdash;To clean brass-plates on doors, so
as not to injure the paint at the edges, cut the size of the plate
out of a large piece of mill-board, place it against the door, and
rub the plate with rotten-stone, or crocus and sweet oil, upon
leather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>81. <em>To clean Mother-o'-pearl.</em>&mdash;Wash in whiting and water.
Soap destroys the brilliancy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>82. <em>To clean Knives and Forks.</em>&mdash;Hold the knives straightly
on the board, and pass them backward and forward in as straight
a line as possible. Forks should be cleaned with a stick covered
with buff-leather, and finished with a brush. The best article
for cleaning is the powder of the well-known Flanders
bricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>83. <em>Of Knife-boards.</em>&mdash;A knife-board properly made, should
consist of an inch-deal-board, five feet long, with a hole at one
end by which it is to be hung up when not in use. At this end,
the left hand, and close to the front edge, should be fastened a
stiff brush for cleaning forks. At the other end should be a
box, with the open end towards the hand, and a sliding lid; this
should contain a bath-brick, leathers for forks, &amp;c., so that the
materials for cleaning may be shut in and hung up with the
board.</p>

<p>Or, cover a smooth board free from knots, with thick buff-leather,
on which spread, the thickness of a shilling, the following
paste:&mdash;emery, one ounce; crocus, three ounces; mixed
with lard or sweet oil. This composition will not only improve
the polish, but also the edges of the knives.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>84. <em>To re-fasten the loose handles of Knives and Forks.</em>&mdash;Make
a cement of common brick-dust and rosin, melted together.
Seal-engravers understand this receipt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>85. <em>Metal Kettles and other Vessels.</em>&mdash;The crust on boilers and
kettles arises from the hardness of the water boiled in them.
Its formation may be prevented by keeping in the vessel a marble,
or a potato tied in a piece of linen.</p>

<p>Tin-plate vessels are cleanly and convenient; but, unless carefully
dried after washing, they will soon rust in holes.</p>

<p>Iron coal-scoops are liable to rust from the damp of the coals.</p>

<p>If cold water be thrown on cast-iron when hot (as the back
of a grate), it will crack. Cast-iron articles are brittle, and cannot
be repaired.</p>

<p>The tinning of copper-saucepans should be kept perfect, clean,
and dry: in which case they may be used with safety.</p>

<p>Copper pans, <em>if put away damp</em>, will become coated with
poisonous crust, or verdigris, as will also a boiling-copper, if
left wet. When used for cooking, and not properly cleaned,
copper vessels have occasioned death to persons partaking of
soup which had been warmed in a pan infected with verdigris.</p>

<p>Untinned copper or brass vessels are at all times dangerous:
it is absurd to suppose, that if the copper or brass pan be scoured
bright and clean, there is little or no danger, for this makes but
a trifling difference; such vessels for culinary purposes ought to
be banished for ever from the kitchen.</p>

<p>A polished silver or brass tea-urn will keep the water hotter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
than one of a dull brown color, such as is most commonly used.
The more of the surface of a kettle that is polished, the sooner
will water boil in it, as the part coated with soot drives off rather
than retains heat.</p>

<p>A polished metal tea-pot is preferable to one of earthenware;
because the earthen pot retains the heat only one-eighth of the
time that a silver or polished metal pot will; consequently, the
latter will best <em>draw</em> the tea.</p>

<p>A German saucepan is best adapted for boiling milk in: this
is a saucepan glazed with white earthenware, instead of being
tinned in the usual manner; the glaze prevents the tendency to
burn, which, it is well known, milk possesses.</p>

<p>A stewpan, made as the German saucepan, is preferable to a
metal preserving-pan; simple washing keeps it sweet and clean,
and neither color nor flavor can by any chance be communicated
to the article boiled in it.</p>

<p>Ornamental furniture, inlaid with brass or buhl, should not
be placed very near the fire, as the metal when it becomes
warm expands, and, being then too large for the space in which
it was laid, starts from the wood.</p>

<p>"German silver" will not rust; but it does not contain a particle
of silver, it being only white copper. If left in vinegar, or
any acid mixture, it will become coated with verdigris. Salt
should never be left in silver cellars, else the metal will be
much injured.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>86. <em>To clean Glasses.</em>&mdash;Glasses should be first washed in
warm clean soap-suds, and rinsed in fresh cold water; wipe off
the wet with one cloth, and finish them with another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>87. <em>Cleaning Decanters.</em>&mdash;Those encrusted with dregs of port
wine, can be readily freed from stain by washing them with the
refuse of the teapot, leaves and all. Dip the decanter into a
vessel containing warm water, to prevent the hot tea-leaves
from cracking the glass, then empty the teapot into the decanter,
and shake it well. The <em>tannin</em> of the tea has a chemical
affinity for the <em>crust</em> on the glass.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>88. <em>To clean Decanters.</em>&mdash;Put into them broken egg-shells,
pieces of coarse brown or blotting paper, with pearlash, and
nearly fill them with lukewarm water; shake them well for a
few minutes, or, if very dirty, leave them for some hours, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
rinse the decanters with cold water. The settlement of the
crust of wine in decanters, may be best prevented by rinsing
at night, with cold water, all the decanters used during the day.
To clean the outer work of decanters, rub it with a damp sponge
dipped in whiting; then brush it well, rinse the vessel in cold
water, drain, and finish with a fine dry cloth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>89. <em>To remove Crust from Glass.</em>&mdash;It often happens that glass
vessels used for flowers and other purposes, receive an unsightly
crust hard to be removed by scouring. The best method is
to wash it with a little diluted spirit of salts, which will soon
loosen it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>90. <em>To cleanse Bottles.</em>&mdash;To cleanse bottles with bad smells,
put into them pieces of blotting or brown paper, and fill up
with water; shake the bottles, and leave them for a day or two,
when, if they be not sweetened, repeat the process, and rinse
with pure water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>91. <em>To restore the Lustre of Glasses tarnished by Age or Accident.</em>&mdash;Strew
on them powdered fuller's-earth, carefully cleared
from sand, &amp;c., and rub them carefully with a linen cloth. Oxide
of tin (putty) would perhaps be better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>92. <em>To clean China.</em>&mdash;<em>China</em> is best cleaned, when very dirty,
with finely-powdered fuller's-earth and warm water; afterwards
rinsing it well in clean water. A little clean soft soap may be
added to the water instead of fuller's-earth. The same plan is
recommended for cleaning glass.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>93. <em>To clean Alabaster.</em>&mdash;Remove any spots of grease with
spirit of turpentine: then dip the article in water for about ten
minutes, rub it with a painter's brush and let it dry; finish by
rubbing it with a soft brush dipped into dry and fine plaster of
Paris.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>94. <em>To bleach Ivory.</em>&mdash;Ivory that has become discolored, may
be brought to a pure whiteness by exposing it to the sun under
glasses; having first brushed the ivory with pumice-stone, burnt
and made into a paste with water. To conceal the cracks in
antique ivory, brush out the dust with warm water and soap,
and then place the ivory under glass. It should be daily exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to the sun, and turned from time to time, that it may
become equally bleached.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>95. <em>Glazed Vessels.</em>&mdash;The glazing of stone ware is sometimes
very imperfect: to test it, nearly fill the vessel with vinegar,
into which put some fat of beef, salted; boil for half an hour,
and set it by for a day, when, if the glazing be imperfect, small
black particles of lead will be seen at the bottom of the vessel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>96. <em>Use of Candle Snuffs for cleaning Glass.</em>&mdash;Candle snuffs
are generally thrown away as useless; they are, however, of
great utility for cleaning mirrors and windows, especially the
former. For this purpose take a small quantity of the burnt
snuffs and rub them with a soft cloth upon the surface of the
mirror. In a short time a splendid polish will appear, superior
to that obtained by other means. We know those who clean
the whole of the windows in a large house with snuffs; and we
are told that not only are the windows cleaned much better but
also much quicker than by the ordinary methods.</p>

<p><em>A Razor Strop Paste</em> is also made of candle-snuffs, and answers
very well. It consists in simply rubbing a small quantity
of the snuffs upon the strop; this imparts a keener edge to
the razor than when no such paste is employed. Mechi's celebrated
Magic Razor Strop Paste is certainly an excellent article,
but we question whether it be much superior to the ordinary
and common-place substance now recommended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>97. <em>To loosen the Glass Stopples of Smelling Bottles and Decanters.</em>&mdash;With
a feather rub a drop or two of olive oil round
the stopple, close to the mouth of the bottle or decanter, which
must be then placed before the fire, at the distance of a foot or
eighteen inches; in which position the heat will cause the oil to
spread downward between the stopple and the neck. When
the bottle or decanter has grown warm, gently strike the stopple
on one side, and on the other, with any light wooden instrument;
then try it with the hand. If it will not yet move,
place it again before the fire, adding, if you choose, another
drop of oil. After a while strike again as before; and by persevering
in this process, however tightly the stopple may be
fastened in, you will at length succeed in loosening it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>98. <em>Or</em>, knocking the stopper gently with a piece of wood,
first on one side, then on the other, will generally loosen it.
If this method does not succeed, a cloth wetted with hot water
and applied to the neck, will sometimes expand the glass sufficiently
to allow the stopper to be easily withdrawn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>99. <em>Crockery and Glass.</em>&mdash;Crockery and glass, to be used for
holding hot water, are best seasoned by boiling them, by putting
the articles in a saucepan of cold water over the fire, and
letting the water just boil; the saucepan should then be removed,
and the articles should be allowed to remain in it till
the water is cold. Some kind of pottery is best seasoned by
soaking in cold water.</p>

<p>Choose thin rather than thick glasses, as the thin glass is less
likely to be broken by boiling water than that which is thicker;
for, thin glass allows the heat to pass through it in least time.
The safest plan is to pour boiling water very slowly into cold
glasses.</p>

<p>As boiling water will often break cold glass, so a cold liquid
will break hot glass; thus wine, if poured into decanters that
have been placed before the fire, will frequently break them.</p>

<p>Glass dishes and stands made in moulds are much cheaper
than others, and they have a good appearance, if not placed
near cut-glass.</p>

<p>Lamp-glasses are often cracked by the flame being too high
when they are first placed round it; the only method of preventing
which is to lower the flame before the glass is put on
the lamp, and to raise the flame gradually as the glass heats.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>100. <em>Polished Tea Urns preferable to varnished ones.</em>&mdash;Polished
tea urns may be kept boiling with a much less expense
of spirits of wine, than such as are varnished; and the cleaner
and brighter the dishes, and covers for dishes, which are used
for bringing food to table, and for keeping it hot, the more effectually
will they answer that purpose.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>101. <em>Japanned Candlesticks and Tea-Trays, and Paper work.</em>&mdash;To
remove grease from these, let the water be just warm
enough to melt it; then wipe them with a cloth, and if they
look smeared, sprinkle a little flour on them, and wipe it clean
off. Wax candles should not be burned in the candlesticks, as
the wax cannot be taken off without injuring the varnish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Paper work is liable to break if let fall, or if boiling water be
poured on it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>102. <em>To clean Lamps.</em>&mdash;Bronzed lamps should be wiped carefully;
if oil be frequently spilled over them, it will cause the
bronzing to be rubbed off sooner than it would disappear by
wear. Brass lamps are best cleaned with crocus or rotten-stone
and sweet oil. Lackered lamps may be washed with soap
and water, but should not be touched with acid or very strong
ley, else the lacker will soon come off. When lamps are foul
inside, wash them with potash and water, rinse them well, set
them before the fire, and be sure they are dry before oil is again
put into them.</p>

<p>Lamps will have a less disagreeable smell, if, before using,
the cottons be dipped in hot vinegar, and dried.</p>

<p>To clean ground-glass shades, wash the insides carefully with
weak soap and water, lukewarm, rub them very lightly and dry
with a soft cloth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>103. <em>To make economical Wicks for Lamps.</em>&mdash;When using a
lamp with a flat wick, if you take a piece of clean cotton stocking,
it will answer the purpose as well as the cotton wicks
which are sold in the shops.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>104. <em>Wax Candles.</em>&mdash;Should they get dirty and yellow, wet
them with a piece of flannel dipped in spirits of wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>105. <em>Blowing out a Candle.</em>&mdash;There is one small fact in domestic
economy which is not generally known; but which is
useful, as saving time, trouble, and temper. If a candle be
blown out holding it above you, the wick will not smoulder
down, and may therefore be easily lighted again; but if blown
upon downwards, the contrary is the case.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>106. <em>Plain Hints about Candles.</em>&mdash;Candles improve by keeping
a few months. Those made in winter are the best. The
most economical, as well as the most convenient plan, is to
purchase them by the box, keeping them always in a cool, dry
place. If wax candles become discolored or soiled, they may
be restored by rubbing them over with a clean flannel slightly
dipped in spirits of wine. Candles are sometimes difficult to
light. They will ignite instantly, if, when preparing them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the evening, you dip the top in spirits of wine, shortly before
they are wanted. Light them always with a match, and do
not hold them to the fire, as that will cause the tops to melt
and drip. Always hold the match to the side of the wick, and
not over the top. If you find the candles too small for the
candlesticks, always wrap a small piece of white paper round
the bottom end, not allowing the paper to appear above the
socket. Cut the wicks to a convenient length for lighting
(nearly close); for if the wick is too long at the top, it will be
very difficult to ignite, and will also bend down, and set the
candle to running. Glass receivers, for the droppings of candles,
are very convenient, as well as ornamental. The pieces
of candles that are left each evening should be placed in a tin
box kept for that purpose, and used for bed lights.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>107. <em>To make an improved Candle.</em>&mdash;Make the wicks about
half the usual size, and wet them with spirits of turpentine;
dry them, before dipping, in the sunshine, or in some favorable
place, and the candles will be more durable, emit a steadier
and clearer blaze, and be in every way superior to those made
in the ordinary way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>108. <em>Quicksilver.</em>&mdash;Tallow will take up quicksilver. Vinegar
kills it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>109. <em>To give any Close-grained Wood the appearance of Mahogany.</em>&mdash;The
surface of the wood must first be planed smooth, and
then rubbed with weak aquafortis; after which it is to be finished
with the following varnish:&mdash;To three pints of spirit of wine
is to be added four ounces and a half of dragon's blood and an
ounce of soda, which have been previously ground together;
after standing some time, that the dragon's blood may dissolve,
the varnish is to be strained, and laid on the wood with a soft
brush. This process is to be repeated, and then the wood possesses
the perfect appearance of mahogany. When the polish
diminishes in brilliancy, it may be speedily restored by rubbing
the article with linseed oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>110. <em>To Darken Mahogany.</em>&mdash;Drop a nodule of lime in a basin
of water, and wash the mahogany with it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>111. <em>To make Imitation Rosewood.</em>&mdash;Brush the wood over
with a strong decoction of logwood, while hot; repeat this process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
three or four times; put a quantity of iron-filings amongst
vinegar; then with a flat open brush, made with a piece of
cane, bruised at the end, or split with a knife, apply the solution
of iron-filings and vinegar to the wood in such a manner as
to produce the fibres of the wood required. After it is dry, the
wood must be polished with turpentine and bees'-wax.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>112. <em>Imitation of Ebony.</em>&mdash;Pale-colored woods are stained in
imitation of ebony by washing them with, or steeping them in
a strong decoction of logwood or galls, allowing them to dry,
and then washing them over with a solution of the sulphate or
acetate of iron. When dry, they are washed with clean water,
and the process repeated, if required. They are, lastly, polished
or varnished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>113. <em>Cheap Coloring for Rooms.</em>&mdash;Boil any quantity of potatoes,
bruise them, and pour on them boiling water until a
pretty thick mixture is obtained, which is to be passed through
a sieve; then mix whiting with boiling water, and add it to
the potato mixture. To color it, add either of the ochres, lampblack,
&amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>114. <em>Cheap Paint.</em>&mdash;Tar mixed with yellow ochre makes an
excellent green paint, for coarse wood-work, iron fencing, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>115. <em>Weather-proof Composition.</em>&mdash;Mix a quantity of sand
with double the quantity of wood ashes, well sifted, and three
times as much <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'slackened'">slaked</span> lime; grind these with linseed oil, and
use the composition as paint; the first coat thin, the second
thick; and in a short time it will become so hard as to resist
weather and time.</p>

<p>Or, slake lime in tar, and into it dip sheets of the thickest
brown paper, to be laid on in the manner of slating.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>116. <em>Artificial Marble.</em>&mdash;Soak in a solution of alum a quantity
of plaster of Paris. Bake it in an oven, and grind it to a
powder. When wanted, mix it with water to about the consistency
of plaster. It sets into an exceedingly hard composition,
and takes a high polish. It may be mixed with various colored
minerals or ochres to represent the various marbles, and is a
valuable receipt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>117. <em>To give Wooden Stairs the Appearance of Stone.</em>&mdash;Paint
the stairs, step, by step, with white paint, mixed with strong
drying oil. Strew it thick with silver sand.</p>

<p>It ought to be thoroughly dry next morning, when the loose
sand is to be swept off. The painting and sanding is to be repeated,
and when dry, the surface is to be done over with pipe-clay,
whiting, and water; which may be boiled in an old saucepan,
and laid on with a bit of flannel, not too thick, otherwise it
will be apt to scale off.</p>

<p>A penny cake of pipe-clay, which must be scraped, is the
common proportion to half a lump of whiting.</p>

<p>The pipe-clay and whiting is generally applied once a week,
but that might be done only as occasion requires.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>118. <em>Lime for Cottage Walls, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Take a stone or two of unslaked
white lime, and dissolve it in a pail of cold water. This,
of course, is whitewash. The more lime used, the thicker it
will be; but the consistence of cream is generally advisable.
In another vessel dissolve some green vitriol in hot water. Add
it, when dissolved, to the whitewash, and a buff is produced.
The more vitriol used, the darker it will be. Stir it well up,
and use it in the same way as whitewash, having first carefully
got off all the old dirt from the walls. Two or three coats are
usually given. For a border at top and base, use more vitriol,
to make it darker than the walls. If you have stencil-plates,
you can use it with them. This is cheap, does not rub off like
ochre, and is pure and wholesome, besides being disinfecting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>119. <em>A White for Inside Painting, which dries in about four
hours, and leaves no smell.</em>&mdash;Take one gallon of spirits of turpentine,
and two pounds of frankincense; let them simmer over
a clear fire till dissolved, then strain and bottle it. Add one
quart of this mixture to a gallon of bleached linseed oil, shake
them well together, and bottle them likewise. Grind any quantity
of white-lead very fine with spirits of turpentine, then add
a sufficient quantity of the last mixture to it, till you find it fit
for laying on. If it grows thick in working, it must be thinned
with spirit of turpentine; it gives a flat, or dead white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>120. <em>A Green Paint for Garden Stands, Trellisses, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Take
mineral green, and white lead ground in turpentine; mix
up the quantity you wish with a small quantity of turpentine-varnish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
this serves for the first coat; for the second, put as
much varnish in your mixture as will produce a good gloss; if
you desire a brighter green, add a small quantity of Prussian
blue, which will much improve the beauty of the color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>121. <em>Cheap and beautiful Green.</em>&mdash;The cost of this paint is
less than one-fourth of oil color, and the beauty far superior.
Take four pounds of Roman vitriol, and pour on it a tea-kettleful
of boiling water; when dissolved, add two pounds of pearl-ash,
and stir the mixture well with a stick until the effervescence
cease; then add a quarter of a pound of pulverized arsenic, and
stir the whole together. Lay it on with a paint brush, and if
the wall has not been painted before, at least two, or even three
coats, will be requisite. If a pea-green is required, put in less,
and if an apple-green, more, of the yellow arsenic.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>122. <em>To Destroy the Smell of Fresh Paint.</em>&mdash;Mix chloride of
lime with water, with which damp some hay, and strew it upon
the floor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>123. <em>To take the Smell of Paint from Rooms.</em>&mdash;Let three or
four broad tubs, each containing about eight gallons of water,
and one ounce of vitriolic acid, be placed in the new painted
room near the wainscot; this water will absorb and retain the
effluvia from the paint in three days, but the water should be
renewed each day during that time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>124. <em>To remove Unpleasant Odors.</em>&mdash;The unpleasant smell of
new paint is best removed by time and atmospheric ventilation;
but tubs of water placed in the apartment, will act more rapidly;
with this inconvenience, however, that the gloss of the paint
will be destroyed. Unpleasant smells from water-closets, or
all articles of furniture connected with them, may be modified
by the application of lime-water, to which may be added the
soap-suds that have been used in washing, which neutralize the
pungently offensive salts; a little quick-lime put into a night-chair
will destroy all disagreeable effluvia. Aromatic pastiles
of the following composition may be burned with great success:
take of camphor, flowers of benzoin, powdered charcoal, powdered
cascarilla bark, powdered Turkey myrrh, and powdered
nitre, each equal quantities; beat them with syrup sufficient to
form a mass, and divide into pastiles of a conical shape. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
may be mixed up with spirit of turpentine (the rectified oil) or
anything that is inflammable. Syrup does best, as it is most
adhesive.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>125. <em>To prevent disagreeable Smells from Privies, Night Chairs,
&amp;c.</em>&mdash;Milk of lime (water in which lime has been slaked, and
which is whitened by the fine particles of that substance) must
be mixed with a ley of ashes, or soapy water that has been
used in washing, then thrown into the sink of the privy; it will
destroy the offensive smell. By these means, for the value of a
few pence, any collection of filth whatever may be neutralized.</p>

<p>For the night-chair of sick persons, put within the vessel
half a pound of quicklime, half an ounce of powdered sal-ammoniac,
and water one pint: this will prevent any disagreeable
odor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>126. <em>Remarks.</em>&mdash;Quicklime, or even lime just slaked, answers
the purpose without any addition. It is the only thing used in
camps, particularly in hot countries, to keep the ditches from
creating contagion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>127. <em>To clean Books or Prints.</em>&mdash;Ink spots may be removed
by oxalic acid dissolved in water, and carefully applied with a
hair pencil. To remove oil or grease, warm the spot, lay over
it blotting paper, and upon it the heated blade of a knife, when
the blotting-paper will absorb the grease; then apply spirits of
turpentine, with a hair pencil, and restore the whiteness of the
paper with spirits of wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>128. <em>To preserve Books.</em>&mdash;A few drops of any perfumed oil
will secure libraries from the consuming effects of mouldiness
and damp. Russian leather which is perfumed with the tar of
the birch-tree, never moulds; and merchants suffer large bales
of this article to lie in the London Docks in the most careless
manner, knowing that it cannot sustain any injury from damp.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>129. <em>To clean Oil Paintings.</em>&mdash;Clean the picture well with a
sponge, dipped in warm beer; after it has become perfectly dry,
wash it with a solution of the finest gum-dragon, dissolved in
pure water. Never use blue starch, which tarnishes and eats
out the coloring; nor white of eggs, which casts a thick varnish
over pictures, and only mends bad ones by concealing the faults
of the coloring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>130. <em>To Light a Coal Fire.</em>&mdash;A considerable saving of time and
trouble might often be effected, if housemaids would attend to
the following rules in lighting a fire:&mdash;Clear the grate well from
ashes and cinders; then lay at the bottom of it a few lumps of
<em>fresh coal</em>, about the size of ducks' eggs, so as not wholly to obstruct
the air passing between the bars on which they are placed.
This done, put a small quantity of waste paper or shavings next
upon the coal; then a few sticks or pieces of split wood placed
carefully above it, so that they may not project between the
bars; then a layer of the cinders you have before taken from the
grate; and next a few lumps of coal on the top. Take care to
<em>complete</em> this process before applying the light, which may easily
be done afterwards by means of a lucifer match, and you will
seldom fail to have a good fire in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier than to light a fire in the way here recommended,
but the coals and cinders must be laid in place by
hand, and not thrown in anyhow with the shovel. If the kindling
wood be green or damp, it should be dried over night, as
a more miserable task cannot be attempted than to light a fire
with damp materials.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>131. <em>Another Way.</em>&mdash;To light a fire from one already kindled,
put three or four pieces of charcoal between the bars of the
grate; then lay a few pieces of fresh coal upon the bottom of
the grate in which the second fire is to be made, and place upon
them, crosswise, the lighted pieces of charcoal; cover them with
pieces of fresh coal, and blow them with the hand-bellows,
when the charcoal will set fire to the fresh coal, and a brisk fire
will be made in a few minutes. On the contrary, if we light a
fire with wood, some time must elapse before it can safely be
blown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>132. <em>Economy in Fuel.</em>&mdash;A saving of nearly one-third of the
coal consumed may be made by the following easy means:&mdash;Let
the coal ashes, which are usually thrown into the dust bin,
be preserved in a corner of the coal hole, and make your servants
add to them from your coal heap an equal part of the
small coal or slack, which is too small to be retained in the
grate, and pour a small quantity of water upon the mixture.
When you make up your fire, place a few round coals in front,
and throw some of this mixture behind; it saves the trouble of
sifting your ashes, gives a warm and pleasant fire, and a very
small part only will remain unburnt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>133. <em>Fire Balls.</em>&mdash;Mix one bushel of small coal, or saw-dust,
or both, with two bushels of sand, and one bushel and a half
of clay; make the mixture into balls with water, and pile them
in a dry place, to harden them. A fire cannot be lighted with
these balls; but when it burns strong, put them on above the
top bar, and they will keep up a strong heat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>134. <em>To prevent the ill effects of Charcoal.</em>&mdash;Set over the burning
charcoal a vessel of boiling water, the steam of which will
prevent danger from the fumes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>135. <em>Method of sweeping Chimneys without employing Children,
and the danger attending the old Method pointed out.</em>&mdash;Procure
a rope for the purpose, twice the length of the height of
the chimney; to the middle of it tie a bush (broom furze, or
any other), of sufficient size to fill the chimney; put one end of
the rope down the chimney (if there be any windings in it, tie
a bullet or round stone to the end of the rope), and introduce
the wood end of the bush after the rope has descended into the
chamber; then let a person pull it down. The bush, by the
elasticity of its twigs, brushes the sides of the chimney as it descends,
and carries the soot with it. If necessary, the person at
the top, who has hold of the other end of the rope, draws the
bush up again; but, in this case, the person below must turn
the bush, to send the wood end foremost, before he calls to the
person at top to pull it up.</p>

<p>Many people, who are silent to the calls of humanity, are
yet attentive to the voice of interest: chimneys cleansed in this
way never need a tenth part of the repairs required where they
are swept by children, who being obliged to work themselves
up by pressing with their feet and knees on one side, and their
back on the other, often force out the bricks which divide the
chimneys. This is one of the causes why, in many houses, a
fire in one apartment always fills the adjoining ones with smoke,
and sometimes even the neighboring house. Nay, some houses
have even been burnt by this means; for a foul chimney, taking
fire, has been frequently known to communicate, by these
apertures, to empty apartments, or to apartments filled with
timber, where, of course, it was not thought necessary to make
any examination, after extinguishing the fire in the chimney
where it began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>136. <em>To revive a dull Fire.</em>&mdash;Powdered nitre, strewed on the
fire, is the best bellows that can be used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>137. <em>Fires, Stoves, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;It is wasteful to wet small coal,
though it is commonly thought to make a fire last longer: in
truth, it wastes the heat, and for a time makes a bad fire.</p>

<p>A close stove intended to warm an apartment should not
have a polished surface, else it will keep in the heat; whereas,
if of rough and unpolished cast iron, the heat will be dispersed
through the room.</p>

<p>Long, shallow grates, are uneconomical, as the body of the
coal in them is not soon heated, and requires to be oftener replenished
to keep up the fire.</p>

<p>A good fire should be bright without being too hot: the best
and quickest mode of making up a neglected fire is to stir out
the ashes, and with the tongs fill up the spaces between the
bars with cinders or half-burnt coals: this method will soon
produce a glowing fire. If coke can be mixed with coals, the
fire will require extra attention: coke, however, makes too
much dust for fires in the best rooms.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>138. <em>Water.</em>&mdash;Hard water by boiling may be brought nearly
to the state of soft. A piece of chalk put into spring water will
soften it.</p>

<p>Rain, or the softest water, is better adapted than any other
for washing and cleaning; but it must be filtered for drinking
in large towns, as it becomes impure from the roofs and plaster
of houses. The best water has the greatest number of air bubbles
when poured into a glass. Hard water will become thick
and foul sooner than soft water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>139. <em>To purify Water for drinking.</em>&mdash;Filter river water
through a sponge, more or less compressed, instead of stone or
sand, by which the water is not only rendered more clear, but
wholesome; for sand is insensibly dissolved by the water, so
that in four or five years it will have lost a fifth part of its
weight. Powder of charcoal should be added to the sponge
when the water is foul, or fetid. Those who examine the large
quantity of terrene matter on the inside of tea-kettles will be
convinced all water should be boiled before drunk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>140. Or, take a large flower-pot, and put either a piece of
sponge or some cleanly-washed moss over the hole at the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Fill the pot three-quarters with a mixture of equal parts
of clean sharp sand, and charcoal in pieces the size of peas. On
this lay a piece of linen or woollen cloth, large enough to hang
over the sides of the pot. Pour the water to be filtered into the
basin formed by the cloth, and it will come out pure through the
sponge or moss at the bottom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>141. <em>To purify River, or Muddy Water.</em>&mdash;Dissolve half an
ounce of alum in a pint of warm water, and stirring it about in
a puncheon of water from the river, all the impurities will soon
settle to the bottom, and in a day or two it will become quite
clear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>142. <em>To purify muddy Water of Rivers or Pits.</em>&mdash;Make a
number of holes in the bottom of a deep tub; lay some clean
gravel thereon, and above this some clean sand; sink this tub
in the river or pit, so that only a few inches of the tub will be
above the surface of the water; the river or pit water will filter
through the sand, and rise clear through it to the level of the
water on the outside, and will be pure and limpid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>143. <em>Method of making putrid Water sweet in a Night's Time.</em>&mdash;Four
large spoonfuls of unslaked lime put into a puncheon
of ninety gallons of putrid water, at sea, will, in one night,
make it as clear and sweet as the best spring water just drawn:
but unless the water is afterwards ventilated sufficiently to carbonize
the lime, it will be a lime water. Three ounces of pure
unslaked lime should saturate ninety gallons of water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>144. <em>Lead Cisterns.</em>&mdash;<em>Lead Cisterns</em> are unsafe to hold water
for culinary purposes: if the water has stood in them several
days undisturbed, a small white coating may be observed at
the upper edge of the water: on any addition of water, this
coating is washed off, and if there be the slightest acidity in the
vessel, this coating will be dissolved in the water, and thus a
poison be conveyed into the stomach. To prevent this, the
insides of lead cisterns should be occasionally examined and
cleared out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>145. <em>To prevent the freezing of Water in Pipes in the Winter
Time.</em>&mdash;By tying up the ball-cock with straw or flannel during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the frost, the freezing of pipes will often be prevented; in fact,
it will always be prevented where the main pipe is higher than
the cistern or other reservoir, and the pipe is laid in a regular
inclination from one to the other, for then no water can remain
in the pipe; or if the main is lower than the cistern, and the
pipe regularly inclines, upon the supply's ceasing, the pipe
will immediately exhaust itself. When water is in the pipes,
if each cock be left a little dripping, the circulation of the water
will prevent its freezing in the pipes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>146. <em>To preserve Water and Meat from Putrefaction in long
Voyages.</em>&mdash;The crews of two Russian ships, which sailed round
the world, were extremely healthy. During the whole three
years of their voyage only two men died of the crew of the
Neva, and the Naveshda did not lose a single man. It is
known that their fresh water was preserved in charred casks,
but it is not so generally known that they used the same precaution
for preserving their salted provisions. The beef they
carried out with them tasted as pleasantly upon their return,
as it did three years before, when first salted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>147. <em>To make Sea-water fit for washing Linen.</em>&mdash;Soda put
into sea-water renders it turbid; the lime and magnesia fall to
the bottom. Therefore, to make sea-water fit for washing linen,
put in soda enough as not only to effect a precipitation of these
earths, but to render the water sufficiently alkaline.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>148. <em>Steam.</em>&mdash;When the steam from a tea-kettle appears
cloudy, it should be taken from the fire, as the water is then fast
boiling away; the steam when the water first boils being quite
transparent, so as scarcely to be seen near the mouth of the
spout. The top of the kettle should be kept bright, as a polished
surface keeps in the heat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>149. <em>To clean a Carriage.</em>&mdash;Wash the body and wheels with
a mop, brush, and plenty of water. Then blacken and clean
all the straps and leather, first cleaning the brass or other ornaments
as those on harness. Next brush the inside lining, clean
the glasses, and clean and trim the lamps. Stains may be removed
from panels by rubbing them with sweet oil on baize.
The wheels should be occasionally greased or oiled, and the
linchpins examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>150. <em>For Coach Wheels.</em>&mdash;Melt over a slow fire one pound
of lard, and half a pound of black lead in powder, stirring them
well; remove the mixture from the fire, and stir till cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>151. <em>Harness Makers' Jet.</em>&mdash;Take one drachm of indigo, a
quarter of an ounce of isinglass, half an ounce of soft soap, four
ounces of glue, one pennyworth of logwood raspings, and one
quart of vinegar; boil the whole together over a slow fire, till
reduced to one pint. A small quantity is then to be taken up
on a piece of clean sponge, and thinly applied to harness, boots,
&amp;c., taking care that they are previously well cleaned.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;A small quantity of sulphate of iron (green vitriol)
would perhaps greatly improve this.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>152. <em>To clean Harness.</em>&mdash;Having washed off the wet dirt,
sponge the harness clean, and hang it up to dry. Next, brush
it with a dry, hard brush, and clean the brass ornaments.</p>

<p>For this purpose, mix a quarter of a pint of turpentine, with
two ounces of rotten-stone, two ounces of finely-powdered charcoal,
and a quarter of a pint of droppings of sweet oil; apply
this paste with leather, and polish it off with powdered charcoal.</p>

<p>Or, clean the brass ornaments with the following mixture,
which is used in the Royal Mews: dissolve one ounce of oxalic
acid in a pint of water, to which add a pint of naphtha. To give
the brass-work a fine color, powder some sal-ammoniac, moisten
it with water, and rub it upon the ornaments; then heat them
over charcoal, and polish with dried bran and whiting.</p>

<p>Or, wash the brass-work with a strong solution of roche alum,
and polish it with tripoli.</p>

<p>To restore the color of harness, clean it, and brush over it
the following mixture:&mdash;boil half a pound of logwood chips in
three quarts of soft water, to which add three ounces of galls
bruised and one ounce of alum.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>153. <em>Oiling Old Leather.</em>&mdash;A practice is common of wetting
harness, &amp;c., before it is to be oiled, under the idea that it soaks
in the oil better for wetting. No two things are less capable
of union than oil and water. The leather appears soft after the
above practice, but a dry day will soon show how hard the
leather becomes when the water it has imbibed has evaporated,
and how rotten the heart of the leather is, although the outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
appears yet oily. If leather be dry and then oiled, the quantity
of oil consumed will tell whether the leather has absorbed the
oil or not. If it have, it will last for years, if it be oiled thoroughly
every spring. The most durable stuff to nail up garden
trees, is leather soaked in oil, and then drained before use. Old
shoes and harness will thus be of use when no longer of service
to the body.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>154. <em>General Washing.</em>&mdash;Counterpanes, blankets, bed-hangings,
&amp;c., should be washed in summer, as they will then dry
quickly, and be of good color.</p>

<p>By putting linen and cotton stockings to soak the night before
they are to be washed, much soap and labor will be saved.</p>

<p>If clothes remain long dirty, they will not only require more
soap and labor, but be much injured in washing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>155. <em>Washing Preparation.</em>&mdash;Half a pound of soap; half a
pound of soda; quarter of a pound of <em>quick</em>-lime. Cut up the
soap and dissolve it in half a gallon of boiling water; pour half
a gallon of boiling water over the soda; and enough boiling
water over the quick-lime to cover it. The lime must be quick
and fresh; if quick, it will bubble up when the hot water is
poured over it. Prepare each of these in separate vessels. Put
the dissolved lime and soda together, and boil them for twenty
minutes. Then pour them into a jar to settle.</p>

<p>Another method of making this preparation is&mdash;Instead of
preparing each of the articles by themselves, dissolve over
night half a pound of soda in one gallon of boiling water, pour
it on the lime, and let it settle; cut up the soap, and pour the
clear water from the lime and soda upon it. In the morning it
will be a dissolved mass, fit for use. In this way the twenty
minutes' boiling of the lime and soda is dispensed with.</p>

<p>In either of these processes white or common yellow soap
may be used. But the lime should be white and quick. If it
does not bubble and hiss when the water is poured on it, it is
unfit for use.</p>

<p>This preparation contains nothing injurious to the linen. It
has been proved by trial that if the directions are rightly followed,
it is less destructive than the old method.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>156. <em>How to proceed after having made the Preparation.</em>&mdash;Set
aside the flannels and colored things, as they <em>must not</em> be washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in this way. They may be washed in the usual way while the
others are boiling.</p>

<p>The night before, the collars and wristbands of shirts, the
feet of stockings, &amp;c., should be rubbed well with soap and set
to soak.</p>

<p>In the morning pour ten gallons of water into the copper,
and having strained the mixture of lime and soda well, taking
great care not to disturb the settlings, put it, together with the
soap, into the water, and make the whole boil before putting in
the clothes. A plate should be placed at the bottom of the
copper to prevent the clothes from burning.</p>

<p>Boil each lot of clothes from half an hour to an hour. Then
rinse them well in cold blue water. When dry they will be
beautifully white.</p>

<p>The same water will do for <em>three</em> lots. Wash the finer things
first.</p>

<p>After having been used for the clothes, the mixture may be
employed for cleaning silver, brass, or any other kind of metal;
which should afterwards be dried and polished with leather.
The liquid may also be used for scouring floors, or cleaning
paint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>157. <em>To make Starch.</em>&mdash;Dissolve as much starch as will be
required in a very small quantity of cold water; then pour boiling
water on it till it is of the right consistency, and let it boil
once or twice.</p>

<p>In <em>mixing starch</em>, put a lump of sugar in it to prevent it from
sticking to the iron. Stirring the starch for a minute with a
sperm candle improves it when it is wanted for shirt bosoms
or collars.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>158. <em>Gum Arabic Starch.</em>&mdash;Get two ounces of fine white gum
arabic, and pound it to powder. Next put it into a pitcher,
and pour on it a pint or more of boiling water, (according to
the degree of strength you desire,) and then having covered it,
let it set all night. In the morning, pour it carefully from the
dregs into a clean bottle, cork it, and keep it for use. A table-spoonful
of gum water stirred into a pint of starch that has been
made in the usual manner, will give to lawns (either white or
printed) a look of newness to which nothing else can restore them
after washing. It is also good (much diluted) for thin white
muslin and bobbinet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>159. <em>To keep Muslins of a good Color.</em>&mdash;Never wash muslins
or any kind of white cotton goods, with linen; for the latter
deposits or discharges a gum and coloring matter every time it
is washed, which discolors and dyes the cotton. <em>Wash them by
themselves.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>160. <em>To wash Flannels.</em>&mdash;Flannels should be washed in soft
water, soap, and much blue. The water should be as hot as
the hands will bear; wring them as dry as possible, shake them
and hang them out; but do not rinse them after the lather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>161. <em>To make Flannels not shrink.</em>&mdash;The first time of washing
put them into a pail of boiling water, and let them lie till cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>162. <em>To scour Flannels.</em>&mdash;Slice half a pound of yellow soap,
and dissolve it in boiling water, so as to make it of the thickness
of oil; cover the flannels with warm water, add a lump of
pearlash, and about one-third of the soap-solution; beat them
till no head rises on the water; then pour it off, and proceed
as before with hotter water, without pearlash.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>163. <em>To wash Woollens.</em>&mdash;Use soft water; and, in order to
make a lather, put half a pound of soap into a gallon of water,
(or as much more in proportion as is necessary,) and boil it
until the soap is dissolved; wash through two waters, (unless
one is found sufficient,) as warm as can be borne, adding, as
you go on, what quantity of the soap-water is needed; wring
them out each time; then throw them into a rinsing-tub, and
fill, to covering, with boiling water. Let them remain until
cool enough to admit of handling, then proceed to rinse well,
and wring them.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;Observe, the rinsing-water must be <em>hard water</em>&mdash;this
is the secret. This method will do for any kinds of woollens;
but for large and strong, such as blankets, or carpets, &amp;c., perhaps
wringing would be better omitted, and in all cases, care
should be taken to spread out the articles straight and smooth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>164. <em>Drying Clothes.</em>&mdash;If the weather be favorable, the drying
may be best finished in the open air; but if the weather be
damp or doubtful, the article should be, without delay, spread
before a fire, or hung in an apartment where there is a strong
current of air. A dry cloth should be placed on the line hedge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
or horse, and the woollen article spread upon it. The more
quickly the drying can be accomplished the better. For this
reason, settled dry weather should be chosen for this kind of
work; if windy, all the better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>165. <em>Family Washing.</em>&mdash;[The following method, though
not generally known, is much practiced in many families.]
Melt together half a pound each of washing soda and of soap
cuttings, mix well with sixteen gallons of water, pour it lukewarm
over the dirty linen, and leave to soak for twenty-four
hours. Drain this water from the clothes, and put them into a
boiler, with a second supply of the same preparation cold, and
let them boil for rather a longer time than if they had been previously
washed. They will then require to be washed out in
clean, warm water, looking carefully over them that the parts
requiring it may be rubbed; afterwards rinse in the usual way.
This direction applies to all white and brown-holland articles.
Bobbinet, and lace, retain their color best, if only <em>scalded</em>, not
<em>boiled</em>. This mode of washing has been adopted for many years
in a family of seven persons; the linen is of an excellent color,
with only half the assistance formerly required, and the quantity
of soap used is much lessened.</p>

<p>N. B. The refuse water is a good manure for fruit trees.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>166. <em>Substitutes for Soap.</em>&mdash;Put any quantity of pearl-ash or
soda into a large jar, cover it lightly, and in a few days it will
become liquid; then mix with it an equal quantity of newly-slaked
lime, and double its quantity of soft water: boil it half
an hour, add as much more hot water, and pour off the liquor.</p>

<p>Two ounces of pearl-ash, used with a pound and a half of
soap, will effect a considerable saving.</p>

<p>For coarse purposes, soft soap is a saving of nearly one-half.
The most economical plan of keeping hard soap, is to cut it into
pieces of about a pound each, and keep it moderately dry.</p>

<p>A little pipe-clay dissolved in the water, or rubbed with the
soap on the clothes, will give the dirtiest linen the appearance
of having been bleached; it will also clean them with about
half the labor, and a saving of full one-fourth of the soap. Pipe-clay
will also render hard water nearly as soft as rain-water.</p>

<p>Carpets, moreen curtains, or other woollen goods, may be
cleaned with the coarse pulp of potatoes, used as a kind of soap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>167. <em>Horse-chestnut Soap.</em>&mdash;It is not generally known that the
horse-chestnut contains a soapy juice, not only useful in bleaching,
but in washing linens and stuffs. The nuts must be peeled
and ground, and the meal of twenty of them will be sufficient
to mix with ten quarts of hot water, with which the clothes may
be washed without soap; the clothes should then be rinsed in
spring-water. The same meal being steeped in hot water, and
mixed with an equal quantity of bran, will make a nutritious
food for poultry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>168. <em>To wash a Cotton Counterpane.</em>&mdash;Slice a pound of mottled
soap, dissolve it in a pailful of boiling water, and add a small
lump of pearl-ash; next, put the counterpane into warm water,
with a bowl of the soap-solution, beat it and turn it, wash it in a
second liquor, and rinse it in cold water; then put three tea-spoonfuls
of liquid blue into a thin liquor, stir together, and
put in the counterpane; beat it a few minutes, and dry it in the
air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>169. <em>To wash Silk Stockings, White and Black.</em>&mdash;Cut in thin
bits some white soap, and boil it in soft water; pour a little of
it among cold, soft water, and wash the stockings, first upon the
inner side; repeat the washing with fresh suds and water, till
they are washed quite clean; turn the outside, the last time of
washing, and if the feet be very dirty, rub a little of the boiled
soap upon them, but not upon the legs. If to be colored, mix
the dye with a little clean suds, and dip in the white stockings;
draw them out smooth, and lay them upon a sheet on a bed,
with the window open, and when almost dry, lay them upon a
piece of flannel, and with another bit rolled up, rub them hard
and quick one way till they are dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>170. <em>To wash Thread Stockings and Gloves.</em>&mdash;Fine thread-stockings
and gloves should be well soaped, put into a lather
of cold water, and boiled; they should then be put into a fresh,
cold lather, and be boiled again; when, on taking them out,
they will require little more than rinsing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>171. <em>To wash Cotton Stockings.</em>&mdash;Lay them in cold water at
night; next day boil them in a copper with some soda and soap;
stir them well about, and they will become quite clean without
any rubbing; rinse them well in cold water, and bleach them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
when nearly dry, draw them smooth, folding them straight over
the instep. Place them under a heavy weight, or iron them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>172. <em>To wash Cotton Bed-furniture, and printed Calicoes in
general.</em>&mdash;1. Get rid of as much dirt as possible, by brushing
and shaking.</p>

<p>2. Do not let the dirty things lie about in a damp wash-house,
or in any way become damp before they are fairly wetted.</p>

<p>3. On no account use a particle of soda, pearl-ash, or any
thing of the kind.</p>

<p>4. Allow plenty of water, and plenty of room in the tub.</p>

<p>5. Use soft water, no hotter than would be pleasant for washing the hands.</p>

<p>6. Rub with soap in the ordinary way. Mottled soap is preferable
to yellow. If a general wash is about, the liquor in
which flannels have been washed the second time, does very well
for the first washing of colored things; or that in which muslins
have been washed a second time, provided no soda or anything
else of the kind was used.</p>

<p>7. When the first washing is completed, have ready another
tub with water of the same degree of warmth, into which put
each piece immediately on wringing it out of the first liquor.</p>

<p>8. Repeat the process of washing in the second liquor, carefully
observing that every part is clean.</p>

<p>9. On wringing out of the second liquor, immediately plunge
each piece into cold <em>spring</em> water for rinsing.</p>

<p>10. On wringing each piece out of the rinsing water, immediately
hang it out, and let it dry as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>11. In hanging up, put any thick double parts next the line,
letting the thinner part hang down and blow about. When
these are dry, the positions may be changed, and the thick
parts hung downwards.</p>

<p>12. If, through unfavorable weather, or any other circumstance,
the drying cannot proceed at once, the things had better
remain all night in the rinsing water, than be laid about damp.
If they are half-dry out-of-doors, when taken in for the night let
them be hung or spread in a room, and again hung out early
next day. If there is no chance of favorable drying abroad,
they should be quickly dried before a fire, or round a stove.</p>

<p>13. If starching is required, a sufficient quantity of made
starch may be stirred into the rinsing water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>173. <em>How to wash Printed Dresses.</em>&mdash;A very cool lather of
white soap, of the best quality, should be used, as the inferior
soaps contain rosin, and other pernicious ingredients most destructive
to colors. Soda, pearl-ash, vinegar, alum, salt, washing-powder,
&amp;c., although they may not injure some colors,
should never be used; for they will most certainly destroy
others. Printed dresses should not be washed with household
or body linen, or put into scalding water. It is desirable to
wash colors with a light hand, so as not to subject them to hard
rubbing, and to rinse with plenty of clean cold water, and to
dry in the open air. Claret, chocolate, purple, lilac, red, pink,
and black, are the most permanent; the cloth for these colors
being prepared in a peculiar manner, and which process has the
effect of better fixing them to it. Blue, green, drab, ruby,
crimson, buff, dahlia, orange, and cinnamon, as they do not admit
of the cloth being so prepared, of course require more
careful treatment, or some of the surface color may possibly on
the first washing scale off and tinge the white, especially if not
well rinsed; but by a little discretion the most delicate colors
may be effectually preserved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>174. <em>To wash Chintz, so as to preserve its Gloss and Beauty.</em>&mdash;Take
two pounds of rice and boil it in two gallons of water,
till soft; when done, pour the whole into a tub; let it stand till
about the warmth you in general use for colored linens; put
the chintz in, and use the rice instead of soap; wash it in this,
till the dirt appears to be out; then boil the same quantity as
above, but strain the rice from the water, and mix it in warm
water. Wash it in this till quite clean; afterwards rinse it in
the water the rice was boiled in; this will answer the end of
starch, and no dew will affect it, as it will be stiff while it is
worn. If a gown, it must be taken to pieces, and when dried,
hang it as smooth as possible; after dry, rub it with a sleek
stone, but use no iron.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>175. <em>To protect Children from Burning.</em>&mdash;Add one ounce of
alum to the last water used in rinsing children's dresses, and
they will be rendered uninflammable, or so slightly combustible
that they would take fire slowly, if at all, and would not flame.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>176. <em>Composition for Washing in Sea-water.</em>&mdash;Mix a strong
solution of potash with an equal weight of pipe-clay, and work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
them to a paste, one pound of which will soften four gallons of
sea-water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>177. <em>To bleach a Faded Dress.</em>&mdash;Wash the dress in hot suds,
boil it and rinse it, then dry it in the sun. Should it not be
rendered perfectly white, lay the dress in the sun for several
days.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>178. <em>To preserve the Color of a Print Dress.</em>&mdash;Rip the skirt
from the body, and wash them in cold rain water in which a
handful of common salt has been thrown. Do not expose it to
the sun to dry, but roll it tightly in a coarse cloth until dry
enough to iron.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>179. <em>To wash White Lace.</em>&mdash;A quarter of a cake of white
wax, six lumps of sugar, and a dessert-spoonful of made starch,
to be mixed with a quart of soft water. Tack the lace very
slightly in a thin cloth dipped in cold water, then let it lie in a
strong lather for one day. Change the water, and leave it in a
second lather all night. Put the above materials into a saucepan,
boil the lace in it for ten minutes, then throw it into cold
water, and when nearly dry iron it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>180. <em>Washing Kid Gloves.</em>&mdash;Have ready a little new milk
in one saucer, and a piece of brown soap in another, and a
clean cloth or towel, folded three or four times. On the cloth,
spread out the glove smooth and neat. Take a piece of flannel,
dip it in the milk, then rub off a good quantity of soap to the
wetted flannel, and commence to rub the glove downwards towards
the fingers, holding it firmly with the left hand. Continue
this process until the glove, if white, looks of a dingy
yellow, though clean: if colored, till it looks dark and spoiled.
Lay it to dry, and the operator will soon be gratified to see
that her old gloves look nearly new. They will be soft, glossy,
smooth, shapely, and elastic. Dark, and especially black
mourning gloves, should be of the very best and high-priced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>181. <em>To iron Shirt Fronts and Dresses.</em>&mdash;Shirt-fronts are most
conveniently ironed upon a deal board about 12 inches long
and 8 wide, covered with fine flannel; to be placed between the
back and front of the shirt, after the back is ironed. The skirts
of dresses also may be ironed in a similar manner, using a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
board as long as the skirt, 26 inches wide at one end, and 12
inches at the other. The board should be covered with a blanket,
and rest upon a thin block of wood at each end, to keep
it from creasing the skirt beneath it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>182. <em>To clean Hair Brushes and Combs.</em>&mdash;Sub-carbonate of
soda or <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'potass'">potash</span> sometimes called salt of tartar or salt of wormwood,
is to be dissolved in boiling water&mdash;two heaped tea-spoonfuls
will be sufficient for half a pint; into this mixture dip
the hairs of the brush, and draw the comb through many times.
The brush and comb, with the help of this solution, will quickly
cleanse each other; dry quickly and they will be as white as
new. Observe two things: the potass must be kept in a stopper
bottle, or it will soon become liquid; when liquid it is not
injured for use, but if left in paper would be wasted; also the
mahogany or satin-wood back of the brush must be kept out
of the solution, as it is apt to discolor wood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>183. <em>To clean Sponge.</em>&mdash;Put into two pints of hot water
about three cents worth of Salts of lemon, and steep the sponge
in it. After it is clean, rinse it in clean water.</p>

<p><em>Or</em>, immerse it in cold buttermilk, and let it soak a few
hours. Then rinse it in pure water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>184. <em>To clean Ermine and Minivar.</em>&mdash;Take a piece of soft
flannel, dip it in common flour, and rub the fur with it, being
careful to rub it against the grain. Shake it well and rub again
with the flannel till all the flour is out of it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>185. <em>To clean Swansdown.</em>&mdash;White swansdown may be
washed in soap and water; after washing, shake it out, and
when the down is somewhat raised, shake it before a clear fire
to dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>186. <em>To clean Leather Cases.</em>&mdash;To clean hat cases, writing-desks,
&amp;c., dissolve in warm water a small quantity of oxalic
acid, and wash the articles with a sponge wet in the solution.
When dry they will look almost equal to new.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>187. <em>To take Stains out of Linen.</em>&mdash;<em>Stains caused by Acids</em>
can be removed by wetting the part, and laying on it some salt
of wormwood; then rub it without diluting it with more water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Or</em>, let the cloth imbibe a little water without dipping, and
hold the part over a lighted match, at a due distance. The
spots will be removed by the sulphureous gas.</p>

<p><em>Or</em>, tie up in the stained part some pearlash; then scrape
some soap into cold soft water to make a lather, and boil the
linen till the stain disappears.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>188. <em>Stains of Wine, Fruit, &amp;c., after they have been long in
the Linen.</em>&mdash;Rub the part on each side with yellow soap; then
lay on a mixture of starch in cold water very thick; rub it well
in, and expose the linen to the sun and air till the stain comes
out. If not removed in three or four days, rub that off and
renew the process. When dry it may be sprinkled with a little
water.</p>

<p><em>Recent Stains of Fruit</em> may be removed by holding the linen
tightly stretched over a tub and pouring hot water over the
part. This must be done before any soap has been applied
to it.</p>

<p><em>Obs.</em> As soon as a stain is made on table-linen, &amp;c., rub on
it common table salt before it has time to dry; the salt will
keep it damp till the cloth is washed, when the stain will disappear;
or wash the stain lightly when the cloth is removed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>189. <em>To restore Scorched Linen.</em>&mdash;Peel and slice two onions,
and extract the juice by squeezing or pounding. Cut up half
an ounce of white soap and two ounces of fullers' earth; mix
with them the onion juice and half a pint of vinegar. Boil this
composition well, and spread it, when cool, over the scorched
part of the linen, leaving it to dry thereon. Then wash out the
linen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>190. <em>To restore Linen that has long been Stained.</em>&mdash;Rub the
stains on each side with wet brown soap; mix some starch to
a thick paste, with cold water, and spread it over the soaped
places; then expose the linen to the air. If the stains do not
disappear in three or four days, rub off the mixture, and repeat
the process with fresh soap and starch. Then dry it, wet it
with cold water, and wash it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>191. <em>Grease or Wax Spots.</em>&mdash;Grease-spots should be rubbed
with strong pearlash and water. Spots of wax or oil paint
should be rubbed with turpentine, and washed with soap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
water: or, wax, if moistened repeatedly with spirits of wine,
may be brushed off. Or, dissolve six ounces of alum in half a
pint of water, warm it, wash the stained part with it, and leave
it to dry.</p>


<p><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'Or (not italicized)'"><em>Or</em></span>, in a quart of warm water, dissolve a little white soap,
and one ounce of pearlash; to which add two spoonsful of ox-gall,
and a little essence of lavender or bergamot: mix the
whole, strain it, and keep it in a bottle. In using it, put a small
quantity on the spot, brush, and wash it with warm water, so
as entirely to remove the liquor applied, which might injure
the cloth if allowed to remain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>192. <em>Other Stains.</em>&mdash;<em>Many other Stains</em> may be taken out
by dipping the linen in sour buttermilk, and drying it in a hot
sun. Then wash it in cold water, and dry it, two or three times
a-day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>193. <em>Ironmoulds.</em>&mdash;Ironmoulds should be wetted, then laid on
a hot water-plate, and a little essential salt of lemons put on the
part. If the linen becomes dry, wet it, and renew the process,
observing that the plate is kept boiling hot. Much of the powder
sold under the name of salt of lemons is a spurious preparation;
and therefore it is necessary to dip the linen in a good
deal of water, and wash it as soon as the stain is removed, to
prevent the part from being worn into holes by the acid. <em>Ink
spots</em> can be removed in the same way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>194. <em>To take Mildew out of Linen.</em>&mdash;Take soap, and rub it
well; then scrape some fine chalk, and rub that also in the
linen; lay it on the grass; as it dries wet it a little, and it will
come out at twice doing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>195. <em>Or</em>, mix soft soap with starch powdered, half as much
salt and the juice of a lemon; lay it on the part on both sides
with a painter's brush. Let it lie on the grass day and night
till the stain comes out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>196. <em>To discharge all Stains which are not Metallic.</em>&mdash;Mix two
tea-spoonfuls of water with one of spirit of salt; let the stain
lie in it for one or two minutes; then rinse the article in cold
water. This will be found particularly useful in removing
stains from white doilys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>197. <em>Prepared Ox-gall for taking out Spots.</em>&mdash;Boil together
one pint of ox-gall and two ounces of powdered alum; to which
add two ounces of common salt; let the liquor settle, add a
few drops of essence of lemon, pour it off into a bottle, and
cork tightly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>198. <em>Salt of Lemons.</em>&mdash;Mix one ounce of salt of sorrel in very
fine powder, with an equal quantity of cream of tartar; this is
the <em>salt</em> sold in the shops; but, as it is only recommended for
removing ironmoulds or ink spots, it will be better to use only
the salt of sorrel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>199. <em>To bleach Linen.</em>&mdash;Mix common bleaching powder, in
the proportion of one pound to a gallon of water; stir it occasionally
for three days, let it settle, and pour it off clear.
Then make a ley of one pound of soda to a gallon of boiling
soft water, in which soak the linen for twelve hours, and boil
it half an hour; next, soak it in the bleaching liquor, made as
above; and lastly, wash it in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Discolored linen or muslin may be restored, by putting a
portion of bleaching liquor into the tub wherein the articles are
soaking.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>200. <em>Use of Potatoes in Bleaching.</em>&mdash;This method of bleaching
consists in substituting for soap, an equal quantity of potatoes
three-parts boiled. The linen is first boiled for nearly an hour;
it is next put into a tub of boiling water, from which each piece
is taken separately, and rubbed with the potatoes, as with soap.
The linen is then boiled with the potatoes for half an hour, next
taken out, rubbed, and rinsed two or three times in cold soft
water, wrung, and hung up to dry. Kitchen linen, which has
mostly the smell of tallow, loses it after having been bleached
by this process.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>201. <em>To Remove fresh Ink Stains.</em>&mdash;Let one person hold the
part that is spotted between his two hands over a basin and rub
it, while another pours water gradually from a decanter upon it,
and let a whole pitcher-full be used if necessary; or if the ruffle,
apron, &amp;c. be at liberty, let it be dipped into a basin filled
with water, and there squeezed and dipped in again, taking care
to change the water every two or three squeezes. If the ink be
spilled on a green table carpet, it may immediately be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
out with a tea-spoon so entirely, that scarcely any water at all
shall be wanted afterwards, provided it was only that instant
spilled, as the down of the cloth prevents the immediate soaking
in of the ink, or of any other liquor (except oil); but if it
have lain some time, be the time ever so long, provided the
place be still wet, by pouring on it fresh clean water, by little
and little at a time, and gathering it up again each time with a
spoon, pressing hard to squeeze it out of the cloth into the
spoon, you will at last bring it to its natural color, as if no
such accident had happened.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>202. <em>To take out Spots of Ink.</em>&mdash;As soon as the accident happens,
wet the place with juice of sorrel or lemon, or with vinegar,
and the best hard white soap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>203. <em>To remove Ink Stains.</em>&mdash;Get a pint cup, or narrow-topped
jug, full of boiling water; place the stained part (of the
linen, &amp;c.) on the top of the cup; dip it in, draw it tight over
the top of the cup, and, while wet and hot, with your finger
rub in a little salt of sorrel. The acid should remain on the
linen for half-an-hour before it is washed. As salt of sorrel is
a powerful poison, the paper should be marked POISON, and
kept carefully locked up, when not in use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>204. <em>The fumes of brimstone useful in removing Spots or Stains
in Linen, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;If a red rose be held in the fumes of a brimstone
match, the color will soon begin to change, and, at length, the
flower will become white. By the same process, fruit-stains or
iron-moulds may be removed from linen or cotton cloths, if the
spots be previously moistened with water. With iron-moulds,
weak muriatic acid is preferable, assisted by heat; as by laying
the cloth on a tea-pot or kettle, filled with boiling water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>205. <em>To remove Stains from Black Bombazine, Crape or
Cloth.</em>&mdash;Boil a large handful of fig-leaves in two quarts of
water until reduced to a pint; squeeze the leaves quite dry,
and put the liquor into a bottle for use. The article should be
rubbed with a sponge dipped in the liquor. The word <span class="smcap">POISON</span>
should be written on the bottle, to prevent any accident.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>206. <em>To clean Black Satin.</em>&mdash;Boil three pounds of potatoes
to a pulp in a quart of water; strain through a sieve, and brush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the satin with it on a board or table. The satin must not be
wrung, but folded down in cloths for three hours, and then
ironed on the wrong side.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>207. <em>To restore Color taken out by Acids.</em>&mdash;Sal-volatile or
hartshorn will suffice for this purpose. It may be dropped on
silk without doing any injury.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>208. <em>To take out Spots on Silk.</em>&mdash;Rub the spots with spirit
of turpentine; this spirit exhaling, carries off with it the oil that
causes the spot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>209. <em>To extract Grease from Silks.</em>&mdash;Scrape French chalk, put
it on a grease-spot, and hold it near the fire, or over a warm
iron, or water-plate filled with boiling water. The grease will
melt, and the French chalk absorb it. Brush or rub it off; repeat
if necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>210. <em>Another way.</em>&mdash;To remove a grease spot from silk,
scrape some French chalk on the wrong side; let it remain
some time, and then brush off. Magnesia is also a good remedy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>211. <em>To extract Grease from Silks or Stuffs (another way).</em>&mdash;Take
a lump of magnesia, and rub it wet over the spot; let it
dry; then brush the powder off, and the spot will disappear.</p>

<p><em>Or</em>, take a visiting or other card; separate it, and rub the
spot with the soft internal part, and it will disappear without
taking the gloss off the silk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>212. <em>To take Spots out of Cloths, Stuffs, Silk, Cotton, and
Linen.</em>&mdash;Take two quarts of spring water, put in it a little fine
white potash, about the quantity of a walnut, and a lemon cut
in slices; mix these well together, and let it stand for twenty-four
hours in the sun; then strain it off, and put the clear liquid
up for use. This water takes out all spots, whether pitch,
grease, or oil, as well in hats, as cloths and stuffs, silk or cotton,
and linen. As soon as the spot is taken out, wash the place
with fair water; for cloths of a deep color, add to a spoonful
of the mixture as much fair water as to weaken it.</p>

<p>Grease spots in cloth may be removed by using soap and
water with a tooth or nail brush, and afterwards wiping off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lather with the wet corner of a towel. Essence of lemon, or
pure spirit of turpentine, will remove pitch from cloth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In woollen cloth, an easier method is to scrape off the hard
tallow with the edge of a tea-spoon, then rub the part briskly
with a clean woollen rag, shifting the rag as the part becomes
dirty; or, place some blotting paper on the spot, and press it
with a hot iron, occasionally moving the paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>213. <em>To clean Silks or Merinoes, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Grate two or three
large potatoes, add to them a pint of cold water, let them stand
a short time, and pour off the liquid clear, or strain it through
a sieve, when it will be fit for use. Lay the silk on a flat surface,
and apply the liquid with a clean sponge, till the dirt is
well separated, dip each piece in a pail of clean water, and hang
up to dry without wringing. Iron whilst damp on the wrong
side. Should the silk be of more than one color, it is desirable
to wet a small piece first, lest the dress should be spoiled, by
moisture causing the colors to run; but for self-colored silks,
the direction is an excellent one; and satinettes, even of light
colors, if not greased or stained, make up again nearly equal to
new.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>214. <em>To clean Silks.</em>&mdash;If of any other color than black, wash
them in a hot lather of soft soap and water, and rinse them in
plain warm water, to which a small quantity of dye may be
added, according to the color: a few drops of vitriol added to
the water will freshen crimson, scarlet, maroon, or bright yellow;
lemon-juice for pink, rose, or carnation; pearlash for blue
and purple; and for olive-green, a pinch of verdigris; but acid
must not be used for fawn, brown, or orange. Then squeeze
the liquid from the silk, roll it in a coarse sheet, and wring it:
spread it out, and rub it on the wrong side with gum-water,
with a little pearlash in it; dry it in a warm room, and finish
with calendering or mangling it.</p>

<p>Black silk should be sponged with hot ox-gall on both sides,
then rinsed, and dried smooth on a board. Or, spread black
plain silks upon a board, soap the dirty place, and brush the
silk on both sides with a fine soap lather; put it into hot water,
rinse it through cold water, and, having squeezed and dried it,
smooth it on the right side with an iron, moderately heated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>215. <em>To make Old Silk look as well as New.</em>&mdash;Unpick the
dress, put it into a tub and cover it with cold water; let it remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
an hour; dip it up and down, but do not wring it; hang
it up to drain. Iron it very damp, and it will look well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>216. <em>To clean Silks.</em>&mdash;A quarter-pound of soft soap, a teaspoonful
of brandy, a pint of gin. Mix all well together. With
a sponge or flannel spread the mixture on each side of the silk
without creasing it. Wash it in two or three pails of cold
water, and iron on the wrong side when rather wet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>217. <em>To remove Stains from Silks.</em>&mdash;Stains produced by vinegar,
lemon-juice, oil of vitriol, or other sharp corrosives, may
often be removed from silks by mixing a little pearlash with
soap-lather and passing the silk through them. Spirits of hartshorn
will also often restore the color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>218. <em>To dip Rusty Black Silk.</em>&mdash;Boil logwood and water
half an hour, in which simmer the silk for the same time; then
take it out, and put into the dye a little blue vitriol, or green
copperas; cool it, and simmer the silk in it for half an hour.
Or, boil a handful of fig-leaves in two quarts of water until it
be reduced to one pint; squeeze the leaves, and bottle the liquor
for use. When wanted, sponge the silk with it.</p>

<p>The word <em>Poison</em> should be written on the bottle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>219. <em>Black Reviver.</em>&mdash;Upon two ounces of powdered logwood,
and half an ounce of green copperas, pour three pints of boiling
water: let it stand till cold, when strain for use, by sponging
the faded stuff with it.</p>

<p>To revive black cloth, boil it with logwood in water for half
an hour, the cloth having been previously cleaned, dipped in
warm water, and squeezed dry; next, take out the cloth, add a
small piece of green copperas, and boil it another half hour;
then hang it in the air an hour or two, rinse it twice or thrice
in cold water, dry it, and finish it with a soft brush, over which
two or three drops of olive oil have been rubbed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>220. <em>White Satin.</em>&mdash;Stone blue and flannel will make white
satin look nearly new, especially if rubbed afterwards with
crumbs of bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>221. <em>Blond Lace.</em>&mdash;When blond lace gets tumbled, breathing
upon it, and afterwards shaking it, will be found to answer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
purpose of an iron, without chance of making the lace look yellow,
as it probably would be by the use of an iron. There is
no necessity for unpicking the lace.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>222. <em>To raise the Surface or Pile of Velvet when pressed down.</em>&mdash;Warm
a smoothing-iron moderately, and cover it with a wet
cloth, and hold it under the velvet; the vapor arising from the
heated cloth will raise the pile of the velvet, with the assistance
of a rush whisk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>223. <em>To remove Grease or Oil Paint from Cloth.</em>&mdash;Moisten
them with a few drops of concentrated solution of subcarbonate
of potash; rub the spot between the fingers, and then wash the
spot with a little warm water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>224. <em>Another way.</em>&mdash;To remove oil paint, rub the part with a
bit of flannel dipped in spirits of wine or turpentine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>225. <em>Spots from Woollen Cloths.</em>&mdash;Fullers' earth, or tobacco
pipe-clay, being put wet on an oil spot, absorbs the oil as
the water evaporates, and leaves the vegetable or animal fibres
of cloth clean, on being beaten or brushed out. When the spot
is occasioned by tallow or wax, it is necessary to heat the part
cautiously by an iron or the fire, while the cloth is drying. In
some kinds of goods, blotting paper, bran, or raw starch, may
be used with advantage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>226. <em>To clean a White or Drab Coat.</em>&mdash;If the coat be much
soiled, brush well into the cloth, the way of the nap some of
the following: mix pounded pipe-clay and whiting, some fullers'
earth, and a little stone blue dissolved in vinegar enough
to form the whole into a paste. When the coat is quite dry,
rub it well, beat it to get out the dust, and brush it well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>227. <em>To clean Cashmere Stuff.</em>&mdash;If common soap be employed,
these valuable fabrics will be injured, and rendered less pliant
and velvety than before. The proper method is to use a soapy
root common in Russia and the East, in the Greek islands, and
in Italy. Its original name is <em>ishkar</em>, and it affords an ash-colored
powder, which, mixed with water into a paste, will free
the stuff from any greasy stains, and leave them the yellow
tint so much prized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>228. <em>To make Portable Balls for removing Spots from Clothes
in general.</em>&mdash;Take fullers'-earth perfectly dried, so that it crumbles
into powder, moisten it with the clear juice of lemons, and
add a small quantity of pure pearl-ashes; then work and knead
the whole carefully together, till it acquires the consistence of
a thick elastic paste; form it into convenient small balls, and
expose them to the heat of the sun, in which they ought to be
completely dried. In this state they are fit for use in the manner
following:&mdash;First, moisten the spot on your clothes with
water, then rub it with the ball just described, and suffer it again
to dry in the sun: after having washed the spot with pure water,
it will entirely disappear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>229. <em>To make Breeches Balls.</em>&mdash;Mix half a pound of Bath
brick in fine powder, one pound of pipe-clay, two ounces of
pumice-stone in fine powder, and three ounces of ox-gall; color
the mixture with yellow ochre, umber, or Irish slate, to the
desired shade, and shape into balls.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>230. <em>Scouring Drops.</em>&mdash;Mix with one ounce of pyroligneous
ether, three drachms of essence of lemon. These will remove
oil or grease from woollen cloth, silk, &amp;c., by rubbing the spot
with a piece of the same article, moistened with the drops.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>231. <em>To take out Wax or Spermaceti from Cloth.</em>&mdash;Hold a red-hot
iron steadily within about an inch of the cloth, and in a few
minutes the wax will evaporate; then rub the cloth with whitish
paper, to remove any mark that may remain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>232. <em>To take Wax out of Velvet of all Colors except Crimson.</em>&mdash;Take
a crummy wheaten loaf, cut it in two, toast it before
the fire, and, while very hot, apply it to the part spotted with
wax. Then apply another piece of toasted bread hot as before,
and continue the application till the wax is entirely taken out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>233. <em>For taking Grease out of the Leaves of Books.</em>&mdash;Fold up,
in two small bags made of fine open muslin, some ashes of
burnt bones, finely powdered, or of calcined hartshorn, which
is always ready prepared at the shops of the druggists. Lay
the bags of muslin containing the powder, one on each side
of the greasy leaf; and, having heated a pair of fire-tongs, or
hair-dresser's pinching-tongs, of a moderate warmth, press with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
them the two bags against the greasy spot, and hold them some
time in that situation. Repeat the process, if necessary.</p>

<p>When the irons cannot be conveniently used, the powder
may be heated over the fire, in a clean earthen vessel; and,
whilst hot, applied, without any muslins, on each side of the
grease spot, and a weight laid on it to assist its effect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>234. <em>To remove Spots of Grease from Paper.</em>&mdash;Take an equal
quantity of roach alum, burnt, and flour of brimstone, finely
powdered together; wet the paper a little, and put a small
quantity of the powder on the place, rubbing it gently with
your finger, and the spot will disappear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>235. <em>To discharge Grease from Leather.</em>&mdash;Apply the white
of an egg to the spot, and dry it in the sun; or, mix two
table-spoonfuls of spirit of turpentine, half an ounce of mealy
potatoes, and some of the best Durham mustard. Apply this
mixture to the spot, and rub it off when dry. A little vinegar
added, renders it more efficacious.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>236. <em>For cleaning light Kid Gloves.</em>&mdash;If the gloves are not
so much soiled as to require wetting, they may be cleaned
thus:&mdash;Scrape fine as much as a tea-spoonful of French chalk.
Put on the gloves as for wear, taking care that the hands be
not only clean, but cool and dry. Put some of the powdered
chalk into the palm of one glove, and rub the hands and fingers
together, just as if the chalk were soap employed in washing
the hands. In this way rub in all the chalk. Then take off
the gloves, without shaking them, and lay them aside for an
hour or two, or a night, if it suit. Again put them on, and
clap the hands together till all the chalk is shaken out. Fullers'
earth, powdered and sifted, may be used in the same manner
as French chalk, and will answer nearly as well. Or, gloves
slightly soiled, may be cleaned by rubbing with a very clean
and dry bit of India-rubber. White kid gloves, or very light
stone-color, or lilac, (not darker than what is called a French
white,) may be stained of a bright and delicate yellow, just
the color of cowslips, by rubbing them with the petals of the
common white rose. The roses must be fresh gathered for
this purpose; and the best method of applying the leaves, is
by putting the glove on its proper hand, and then <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: '.If' missing">rubbing. If</span>
not convenient to do the whole at one time, the effect is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
injured by laying them aside, and taking up again. When
done, they look quite equal to new, and keep clean longer than
gloves of the same color stained in the ordinary way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>237. <em>Another way to clean Kid Gloves.</em>&mdash;First see that your
hands are clean; then put on the gloves and wash them, as
though you were washing your hands, in a basin of turpentine.
Burning fluid will do equally well. Then hang them up in a
warm place, or where there is a good current of air, which will
carry off all smell of turpentine. This method was brought
from Paris, and thousands of dollars have been made by it.
The spirits of hartshorn may be substituted for the turpentine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>238. <em>Washing Gloves.</em>&mdash;If the gloves are so much soiled as
to require washing, the best application is a strong lather made
of curd soap with new milk; or water will do. A very small
quantity of liquid will suffice. Before wetting the glove, run
a strong thread through the opposite sides, close to the wrist
binding. Leave it about a quarter of a yard long, and make
a large knot at each end. This is to form a loop or handle
by which to hang up the glove to dry, and hold it open. Having
prepared the lather, put one glove on the hand, and apply
the lather by means of a shaving brush or a piece of fine flannel,
carrying the strokes downwards&mdash;that is, from the wrist or arm
to the tips of the fingers. Continue this process till the dirt
disappears, though the glove appears of a dingy, ill-looking
color. Then take a clean soft towel, and dab it till the soap
is removed. Take off the glove, blow into it to open all the
fingers, and, by means of the aforesaid loop, hang it to dry
in a shady but airy place. The loop should be fixed to two
pegs, or by two pegs or strings, fastened to a line in such a
manner as to keep the sides of the glove apart while drying.
When dry, they will have regained their original color, and
be smooth, glossy, soft, and shapable. Or, the gloves when
cleaned as above, may be laid to dry on several folds of clean
linen above and below. Limerick gloves should be washed
clean with a strong lather of soap and water, applied with a
brush as above. The lather must not be warmer than new
milk. When dry from the lather, apply a solution of saffron,
stronger or weaker, according to the color desired. A very
small quantity of saffron will suffice. Pour boiling water to it,
and let it steep at least twelve hours before using. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
are frequently cleaning this kind of gloves, may steep a drachm
of saffron in half-a-pint of boiling water, and when cold, put the
whole into a bottle, without straining. Cork it close, and it
will keep a long time for use as required.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>239. <em>To clean Straw Bonnets.</em>&mdash;Put a chafing-dish, with some
lighted charcoal, into a close room or large box; then strew
on the coals an ounce or two of powdered brimstone, and let
the bonnets hang in the room or box for some hours, when
they remain to be blocked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>240. <em>To bleach Straw Hats, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Straw hats and bonnets
are bleached by putting them, previously washed in pure water,
into a box with burning sulphur; the fumes which arise, unite
with the water on the bonnets, and the sulphurous acid thus
formed, bleaches them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>241. <em>Method of Bleaching Straw.</em>&mdash;Dip the straw in a solution
of oxygenated muriatic acid, saturated with potash. (Oxygenated
muriate of lime is much cheaper.) The straw is thus
rendered very white, and its flexibility is increased.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>242. <em>Varnish for Straw or Chip Hats.</em>&mdash;Powder half-an-ounce
of black sealing-wax, put it into a bottle with two ounces
of spirits of wine, and set it in a warm place. Lay it on warm
with a soft hair-brush, before the fire or sun.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>243. <em>Straw Bonnets.</em>&mdash;If a straw bonnet is not worth the
expense of properly cleaning, it may be greatly improved both
in comfort and appearance, by washing it with soap and water,
applied by means of a bit of flannel or sponge. Afterwards
rinse with clean water, and dry quickly in the air. When dry,
wash over with the white of an egg, finely beaten. The wire
had better be removed before washing, and put on afresh.
There is no great art in reducing a straw bonnet for a child.
Take off all the ribs of straw that form a sort of border by going
round the edge; as many also of the straight ribs as will leave
the front nearly of the depth required. From the remaining
front ribs cut off a little at each end; fasten the ends securely,
and again set on the border ribs. Unpick the sewing of the
head-piece, till two, three, or more of the top rounds are taken
off, so as to bring it to the size required. Then sew again as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
many as will bring it to a proper depth. It is not intended to
say, that a person who never learned the art of straw bonnet-making,
and has not the proper blocks, &amp;c., will do it as well
as one who has; but any notionable needle-woman may do it,
so as to look much better than a large bonnet on the small head
of a child. A bonnet-shape of pasteboard or buckram may be
renewed by laying it between two sheets of damp paper, and
ironing with a hot iron. The wire must be previously removed
and afterwards put on afresh. To clean silk and ribbons, wash
in cold rain water with a very little soap. Avoid squeezing
and wringing. If very dirty, two waters may be requisite; the
second may be slightly blued, unless the color of the silk forbids
it (as yellow or red). Spread on a clean towel, and
while damp, iron with a piece of clean paper placed between
the silk or ribbon and the iron.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>244. <em>Paste.</em>&mdash;Take two table-spoonfuls of flour and stir it
into a half pint of cold water until the lumps are all broken,
then pour this into a pint of boiling water, stirring while doing
so; afterwards let it boil up once or twice, and take off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>245. <em>Superior Paste.</em>&mdash;Mix flour and water, with a little
brown sugar, and a very small quantity of corrosive sublimate
in powder, and boil it until sufficiently thick and smooth. The
sugar will keep the paste flexible, and prevent it scaling off
from smooth surfaces, and the corrosive sublimate will check
its fermentation: a drop or two of oil of anise-seed, lavender, or
bergamot will prevent the paste turning mouldy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>246. <em>Bookbinders' Paste.</em>&mdash;Mix wheaten flour first in cold
water, then boil it till it be of a glutinous consistence; this
method makes common paste. Mix a <em>fourth</em>, <em>fifth</em>, or <em>sixth</em> of
the weight of the flour of powdered alum, and if required
stronger, add a little powdered resin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>247. <em>Rice Glue.</em>&mdash;Mix rice flour smoothly with cold water,
and simmer it over a slow fire, when it will form a delicate and
durable cement, not only answering all the purposes of common
paste, but well adapted for joining paper and card-board
ornamental work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>248. <em>A most excellent Glue.</em>&mdash;Beat an ounce of isinglass to
shreds: dissolve it gradually in a pint of brandy, by means of
gentle heat, and then strain the solution through a piece of fine
muslin. The glue thus obtained should be kept in glass closely
stopped. When required for use, it should be dissolved with
moderate heat, when it will appear thin, transparent, and
almost limpid. When applied in the manner of common glue,
its effect is so powerful as to join together the parts of wood
stronger than the wood itself is united. This glue dries into a
very strong, tough, and transparent substance, not easily damaged
by anything but aqueous moisture, which renders it unfit
for any use where it would be much exposed to wet or
damp air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>249. <em>Parchment Glue.</em>&mdash;Take one pound of parchment, and
boil it in six quarts of water till the quantity be reduced to
one, then strain off the dregs, and boil it again till it be of the
consistence of glue.</p>

<p>The same may be done with glovers' cuttings of leather,
which make a colorless glue, if not burnt in the evaporation of
the water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>250. <em>To make Lip Glue, for joining Paper, Silk, or thin
Leather, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Take of isinglass and parchment glues, of each
one ounce; sugar-candy and gum-tragacanth, each two drachms;
add to them an ounce of water, and boil the whole together till
the mixture, when cold, is of the consistence of glue; then form
the same into small rolls, or any other figure that may be most
convenient, and it will be fit for use.</p>

<p>This glue may be wet with the tongue, and rubbed on the
edges of the paper, silk, or leather, that are to be joined; and
on being laid together, and suffered to dry, they will be united
as firmly as any other part of the substance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>251. <em>Liquid Glue.</em>&mdash;Pour naphtha upon shellac until of a
creamy consistence, and keep it closely corked. This glue will
unite iron, wood, glass, &amp;c. It is water-proof, and dries
quickly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>252. <em>Glue to hold against Fire or Water.</em>&mdash;Mix a handful of
quick-lime in four ounces of linseed-oil, boil them to a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thickness, then spread it on tin plates in the shade, and it will
become exceedingly hard; but may be easily dissolved over
the fire, as glue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>253. <em>To mend China.</em>&mdash;Mix together equal parts of fine glue,
white of eggs, and white of lead, and with it anoint the edges
of the article to be mended; press them together, and when
hard and dry scrape off as much of the cement as sticks about
the joint. The juice of garlic is another good cement, and
leaves no mark where it has been used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>254. <em>Cement and Ground Glass Imitation.</em>&mdash;In half-a-pint
spirits of wine steep one ounce of isinglass twenty-four hours,
then dissolve it over a slow fire, keeping the vessel covered
that the spirit may not evaporate (for this purpose a double
saucepan should be used, the outer one containing water, after
the manner of a glue-pot; or the solution may be made in a jar
with a lid, tied over also with bladder, and placed in a saucepan
of water&mdash;the water should surround the jar to the height
of two inches or more, but not so high as to float it). When
the isinglass is completely dissolved, add the juice of garlic,
obtained by pounding in a mortar six cloves of the root, and
straining through linen. Mix well, and cork close for a short
time. The mixture will then cement either glass or crystal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Item number missing; 254a inserted">254a.</span> <em>Cement to resist Fire and Water.</em>&mdash;Half-a-pint each of vinegar
and milk, simmer them together till the curd separates. Strain,
and with the whey mix the whites of five eggs well beaten up.
The mixture of these two substances being complete, add sifted
quick-lime, and make the whole into the consistence of putty.
Let it be carefully applied&mdash;that is, to lay it on every part of
the broken edges, and to make the edges fit exactly; as soon as
it is perfectly dry, it will be found to resist both heat and moisture.
Whatever the article was originally calculated to bear, it
is again fitted to bear as much as if it had never been broken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>255. <em>To imitate Ground Glass.</em>&mdash;Rub the glass over with a
lump of glaziers' putty, carefully and uniformly until the surface
is equally covered. This is an excellent imitation of
ground glass, and is not injured by rain or damp. It is useful
for kitchen windows, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>256. <em>To cement Broken China.</em>&mdash;Mix some oyster-shell powder
with the white of a fresh egg, to the thickness of white paint,
lay it on thick at the two edges and join them as exact and
quick as possible, then put it before the fire till the china is
quite hot, and it will cement in about two minutes. Pour
boiling water into it directly, wipe it dry, scrape it clean on
both sides with a penknife, and it will appear only as a crack.
Mix no more than you can use for one or two things at a time;
for if the cement grows hard, it will be spoiled. The powder
may be bought at the apothecaries'; but it is best prepared at
home, which is done as follows:&mdash;Choose a large, deep oyster-shell;
put it in the middle of a clear fire till red-hot, then take
it out and scrape away the black parts; pound the rest in a mortar
as fine as possible; sift and beat it a second time, till quite
smooth and fine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>257. <em>Obs.</em>&mdash;In cementing china and glass, first heat the portions,
and when the cement is applied, press them closely together,
as the thinner the cement is, the more firmly it holds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>258. <em>To cement Broken China or Glass.</em>&mdash;Beat lime to the
finest powder, and sift it through fine muslin; then tie some
into a thin muslin; put on the edges of the broken china some
white of egg; dust some lime quickly on the same, and unite
them exactly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>259. <em>Chinese method of mending China.</em>&mdash;Take a piece of
flint-glass, beat it to a fine powder, and grind it well with the
white of an egg, and it joins china without riveting, so that no
art can break it in the same place. You are to observe, that
the composition is to be ground extremely fine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>260. <em>Improved Corks for preserving Wine or Chemical Liquors.</em>&mdash;Melt
together two parts of white wax and one part
of beef suet; dip your corks in this mixture, and immediately
dry them in a stove upon an iron plate; repeat this operation
twice, and the corks thus prepared will preserve any liquor
well without imparting any ill-flavor thereto.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>261. <em>Bottle Cement.</em>&mdash;Common red and black sealing-wax, of
each half-a-pound; bees'-wax, quarter of an ounce. Melt them
in an earthen pipkin or brass kettle. The former is preferable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
because the cement may be kept in it, and again melted whenever
it is wanted for use. When the mixture begins to froth,
and seems likely to boil over, stir with a tallow candle, which
will settle the froth. As soon as the whole is melted, it is
ready for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>262. <em>Bottle Cement.</em>&mdash;Melt in an iron ladle some rosin, and a
quarter as much bees'-wax; add a little Venetian red, stir with
a piece of candle, and, when smoothly melted, dip in the top
of the bottles, so as completely to cover them. In making this
cement, be careful not to leave it a moment while it is on the
fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>263. <em>Blood Cement.</em>&mdash;Blood Cement, for repairing copper
boilers, &amp;c., is made by pounded quick-lime and ox-blood
mixed together: it must be applied fresh made, as it soon becomes
so hard as to be unfit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>264. <em>Diamond Cement.</em>&mdash;Diamond Cement, for glass or
china, is made by dissolving a quarter of an ounce of isinglass
in water, by boiling it to the consistence of cream. Add a
table-spoonful of spirits of wine. Use warm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>265. <em>Cement for attaching Metal to Glass or Porcelain.</em>&mdash;Take
two ounces of a thick solution of glue, and mix with one
ounce of linseed oil varnish, or three-quarters of an ounce of
Venice turpentine. Boil together, agitating them until thoroughly
mixed. The pieces to be cemented should be left
untouched, after having been united, for forty-eight or sixty
hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>266. <em>To mend Tortoise-Shell.</em>&mdash;To mend tortoise-shell, bring
the edges of the pieces to fit each other, observing to give the
same inclination of grain to each; then secure them in a piece
of paper, and place them between hot irons or pincers; apply
pressure, and let them cool. Take care that the heat is not too
great, or it will burn the shell.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>267. <em>To clean Gold Chains, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Make a lather of soap and
water; boil the chain in it for a few minutes, and immediately on
taking it out, lay it in magnesia powder which has been heated
by the fire; when dry, rub it with flannel; if embossed, use a
brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Or:</em>&mdash;Wash it well in soap and water, and put it while wet
into a bag with some fresh, clean bran; shake it well, and in a
few minutes it will be found perfectly clean.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>268. <em>To restore Pearls.</em>&mdash;Soak them in hot water in which
bran has been boiled, with a little salt of tartar and alum, and
rub them gently between the hands; rinse them in lukewarm
water, and lay them out to dry.</p>

<p>To preserve the color of pearls, keep them in dry common
magnesia, instead of the cotton-wool used in jewel-cases, and
they will never lose their brilliance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>269. <em>To clean Gold or Silver Lace.</em>&mdash;Rub it gently with cotton
wool, or a soft brush dipped in spirits of wine, taking care
not to injure the silk beneath.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>270. <em>To clean Gold and Silver Lace.</em>&mdash;Sew the lace in linen
cloth, and boil it in a pint of water, and two ounces of soap;
and then wash the lace in water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>271. <em>To improve Gilding.</em>&mdash;Mix one gill of water, two ounces
of purified nitre, one ounce of alum and one ounce of common
salt. Lay this over gilt articles with a brush, and their color
will be much improved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>272. <em>Incombustible Varnish for Wood.</em>&mdash;Equal parts of alum
and isinglass, dissolved and mixed, applied to wood, prevents it
from burning. Liquids can be boiled in a wooden vessel on a
common fire, if this varnish be applied to it. The wood chars
sometimes, but does not flame.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>273. <em>Cement for Iron Flues.</em>&mdash;Common salt and sifted wood-ashes
in equal parts, made into a paste with water, is a very
good cement for iron flues, and may be applied when the flue
is hot or cold. Iron filings and vinegar will do almost as well,
or rather iron filings moistened with diluted muriatic acid.
These are generally used for filling up the space between cylinders.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>274. <em>Preparation of common Cement for joining Alabaster,
Marble, Porphyry, or other Stones.</em>&mdash;Take of bees'-wax two
pounds, and of rosin one pound; melt them, and add one pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and a half of the same kind of matter, (powdered,) as the body
to be cemented is composed of, strewing it into the melted
mixture, and stirring them well together, and afterwards kneading
the mass in water, that the powder may be thoroughly incorporated
with wax and rosin. The proportion of the powdered
matter may be varied, where required, in order to bring
the cement nearer to the color of the body on which it is employed.</p>

<p>This cement must be heated when applied; as must also the
parts of the subject to be cemented together; and care must be
taken likewise, that they be thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>When this composition is properly managed, it forms an
extremely strong cement, which will even suspend a projecting
body of considerable weight, after it is thoroughly dry and set,
and is therefore of great use to all carvers in stone, or others
who may have occasion to join together the parts of bodies of
this nature.</p>

<p>Melted sulphur, applied to fragments of stones previously
heated (by placing them before a fire) to at least the melting
point of sulphur, and then joined with the sulphur between,
makes a pretty firm and durable joining.</p>

<p>Chips out of corners, and similar little deficiencies in the
stone, may also be filled up with melted sulphur, in which some
of the powder of the stone has been mixed: but the stone should
be previously heated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>275. <em>Strong Cement.</em>&mdash;To prevent the escape of the vapors
of water, spirit, and liquors not corrosive, the simple application
of slips of moistened bladder will answer very well for
glass, and paper with good paste for metal. Bladder, to be
very adhesive, should be soaked some time in water moderately
warm, till it feels clammy, it then sticks very well; if smeared
with white of eggs instead of water, it adheres still closer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>276. <em>To scour a Hat.</em>&mdash;Rub yellow soap on a hard brush, dip
it into boiling water, and brush the hat round with the nap; if
the nap be clotted, continue to brush it till it is smooth, and
free from soap; then, if requisite, scrape out the dirt, by passing
round the hat an edged piece of wood, or the back of a knife;
next, beat the nap with a cane, hang the hat to dry, and pass a
heated flat iron two or three times gently over it; brush it
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>277. <em>Management of Razor Strops.</em>&mdash;Most razor strops are
spoiled by being left too dry; a drop or two of sweet oil, frequently
added to the strop, would remedy this; and, after using
the strop, passing the razor on the inside of a warm hand, gives
the smoothest and finest edge; putting the razor in warm water
makes it cut very keen, and perhaps nothing makes a better
razor strop than crocus martis, with a little sweet oil, rubbed
well on leather with a glass bottle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>278. <em>To prevent Gentlemen's Hats from being injured by Rain.</em>&mdash;Shake
off the water as much as possible; then with a clean
linen cloth or silk handkerchief wipe the hat carefully, keeping
the beaver flat and smooth, in the same direction as it was first
placed; then with hands fix it in the original shape, and hang it
at a distance from the fire to dry. A few hours after, or the
next morning, lay the hat on the table, and brush it round and
round several times with a soft brush in the proper direction,
and you will find your hat not in the least injured by the rain.</p>

<p>If the gloss is not quite so high as you wish, take a flat iron,
moderately heated, and pass the same two or three times gently
over the hat; brush it afterwards; and it will be nearly as handsome
as when first sent home from the shop.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>279. <em>Dyeing.</em>&mdash;Occasionally, when colored articles of silk,
wool, or cotton have been cleaned, their color requires to be
made deeper; at other times, it maybe desirable to change
the color altogether, when that already in the stuff must be
discharged, and the article dyed anew.</p>

<p>Articles of any color may be dyed black, and black may
easily be re-dyed. Blues can be made green or black; green
may be made brown, and brown, green; and any color on re-dyeing,
will take a darker tint than at first. A black may be
dyed maroon, claret, or dark-brown; but green is the best color
into which black can be changed.</p>

<p>Most colors can be discharged by boiling the articles in water,
with a small quantity of spirits of salts in it. Yellows, browns,
and blues, are not easily discharged; maroons, reds of some
kinds, and olives, may be easily discharged, by boiling them
in water, with a small quantity of the following articles: roche-alum,
for maroons; oil of vitriol&mdash;a very small quantity&mdash;for
olives and grays; alum, pearlash, or soap, will discharge green
to a yellow, which may be boiled off with soap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>280. <em>To Alum Silks.</em>&mdash;Silk should be alumed cold, for when
it is alumed hot, it is deprived of a great part of its lustre.
The alum liquor should always be strong for silks, as they take
the dye more readily afterwards.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>281. <em>Various Dyes.</em>&mdash;The following are the articles employed
for the colors most in use, the proportions depending upon the
depth or the shade required.</p>

<p><em>Lilac and Purple.</em>&mdash;Boil archil in water; or, boil logwood
in water; and, when cold, dip the article to be dyed into it,
having previously passed it through a weak solution of alum
in water. From logwood also may be obtained different shades
of <em>Violet</em>.</p>

<p>Effective <em>Lilac</em> dyes may be produced from the berries of
the Portugal laurel; and from the black currant, after the juice
has been expressed.</p>

<p><em>Red</em> is obtained from madder, and Brazil wood; the article
being first dipped in weak alum and water, then in the dye,
and lastly in a decoction of archil and water, to give it a bloom.</p>

<p><em>Rose</em>, <em>Flesh-color</em>, <em>Poppy</em>, and <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'Cherrry-red'"><em>Cherry-red</em></span>, are obtained from
a decoction of carthamus in water, with a little soda and lemon
juice. For a poppy-color, the article should first be dipped in
a weak solution of arnatto in water; and for a pale carnation,
a little soap should be added to the carthamus.</p>

<p><em>Pink Bloom.</em>&mdash;Archil is employed to give a bloom to pinks,
whites, &amp;c., as for silk stockings; for which purpose, also, pink
saucers are used.</p>

<p><em>Scarlet</em> is obtained from cochineal; but, for cotton and wool,
the color derived from it is little superior to that given by
madder.</p>

<p><em>Nankeen</em> is obtained from Spanish arnatto dissolved in hot
water, with a small portion of pearlash in it.</p>

<p><em>Blue</em> is prepared from indigo; but, as this dye is not easily
made, it will be better to purchase a bottle of "Blue Dye."</p>

<p><em>Yellow</em> may be obtained from the juice of the tops of potato-flowers,
fustic chips, weld or dyers' weed, turmeric, and Dutch
pink.</p>

<p><em>Green</em> consists of blue and yellow dyes, mixed.</p>

<p><em>Orange</em> is extracted from carthamus. <em>Cinnamon</em> from logwood,
Brazil wood, and fustic, mixed; or from a strong decoction
made from the green tops and flowers of the common heath.</p>

<p><em>Black</em> is formed by logwood and green copperas boiled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
water; the color being improved by first boiling the article
with galls, or alder-bark, in water; or by first dyeing it with
walnut-peels.</p>

<p><em>Gray</em> is produced by diluting black dye.</p>

<p><em>Brown</em> is obtained from walnut-peels, or the bark of birch.</p>

<p><em>Olives</em> are made from blue, red, and brown.</p>

<p>The pericarp of the Scotch rose contains a fine purple juice
which, diluted with water, dyes silk and muslin <em>Peach-color</em>;
the addition of alum will make it a deep <em>Violet</em> dye.</p>

<p>In all cases, except otherwise specified, the article to be dyed
should be first steeped in a weak solution of alum in water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>282. <em>To dye the Linings of Curtains, Furniture Covers, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Wash
the articles clean, and, having prepared the dye according
to either of the previous recipes, dip them, rinse them in
pump water, then in water-starch; dry them quickly, and mangle
or calender them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>283. <em>To dye Silk Stockings.</em>&mdash;Wash and <em>boil</em> the stockings,
if requisite, in soap and water, and rinse them in clear hot
water. Put three table-spoonfuls of archil into a wash-hand
basin of hot water, in which soak the stockings until they become
of a lilac shade, when rinse them lightly in cold water.
Dry them in fumes of brimstone, and when they are bleached
to the required flesh-color, rub the right side with clean flannel
or glass, and iron them. If the pink saucer-color be used instead
of archil, the stockings will not require bleaching with
brimstone.</p>

<p><em>For Black Stockings.</em>&mdash;Having dyed them, finish them on
wooden legs, by rubbing them with flannel moistened with
olive oil. Rub each pair half an hour.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>284. <em>To dye Gloves to look like York Tan.</em>&mdash;Put some saffron
into one pint of soft water boiling hot, and let it infuse all
night; next morning wet the leather with a brush. The tops
should be sewn close to prevent the color from getting in.</p>

<p><em>To dye White Gloves a beautiful Purple.</em>&mdash;Boil 4 ozs. of logwood
and 2 ozs. of roche-alum in 3 pints of soft water till half-wasted.
Let it stand to be cold after straining. Let the
gloves be nicely mended; then do them over with a brush, and
when dry repeat it. Twice is sufficient, unless the color is to
be very dark. When dry, rub off the loose dye with a coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cloth. Beat up the white of an egg, and with a sponge rub it
over the leather. The dye will stain the hands, but wetting
them with vinegar before they are washed will take it off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>285. <em>To dye Straw and Chip Bonnets Black.</em>&mdash;Boil them in
strong logwood liquor three or four hours, occasionally adding
green copperas, and taking the bonnets out to cool in the air,
and this must be continued for some hours. Let the bonnets
remain in the liquor all night, and the next morning take them
out, dry them in the air, and brush them with a soft brush.
Lastly, rub them inside and out with a sponge moistened with
oil, and then send them to be blocked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>286. <em>To make Nankeen Dye.</em>&mdash;Boil equal parts of arnatto and
common potash in water, till the whole are dissolved. This
will produce the <em>pale reddish buff</em> so much in use, and sold
under the name of <em>Nankeen Dye</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>287. <em>To dye Cotton a fine Buff Color.</em>&mdash;Let the twist or yarn
be boiled in pure water, to cleanse it; then wring it, run it
through a dilute solution of iron in the vegetable acid, which
printers call <em>iron liquor</em>; wring, and run it through lime-water,
to raise it; wring it again, and run it through a solution of
starch and water; then wring it once more, and dry, wind,
warp, and weave it for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>288. <em>To dye Worsted or Woollen Black.</em>&mdash;Put in half a gallon
of water a piece of bi-chromate of potash, the size of a horse-bean.
Boil the articles in this seven or eight minutes. Take
them out and wash them. Then in another half-gallon of water
put in one table-spoonful and a half of ground logwood; boil the
articles in this the same length of time as before. Then wash
them in cold water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>289. <em>To dye Hair and Feathers Green.</em>&mdash;Take of verdigris or
verditer 1 oz., gum water, 1 pint; mix them well, and dip the
hair or feathers into the mixture, shaking them well about.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>290. <em>Waterproof Clothing.</em>&mdash;First make the cloak, coat, or
trowsers of <em>linen</em>; then soak them well for a day or two in
<em>boiled</em> oil; then hang them up in a dry place till perfectly dry,
without wringing the oil out; then paint them, without turpentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
or dryers being in the paint, black, or any other color you
like, and lay the paint on thinly, and let it dry. (This is the
method practised by seamen.)</p>

<p><em>Waterproof Clothing.</em>&mdash;Make the garment of strong unbleached
calico; hang it up in a dry place, and, with a brush, give it
two coats of boiled linseed oil. Buy the oil ready-boiled; a
pint will be sufficient for a cape or pair of overalls. Canvas
may be prepared in the same way for rick-cloths, or other roofing
purposes.</p>

<p><em>Another way.</em>&mdash;Get some weak size, such as is used by paper-makers;
make it hot, and stir a small lump of alum, and a
small quantity of soap lather into it. Then with a brush apply
it to the garment equally all over, as recommended above with
the oil. If the garment be of good cloth, the size may be laid
on inside.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>291. <em>Chinese Method of rendering Cloth Waterproof.</em>&mdash;To one
ounce of white wax, melted, add one quart of spirits of turpentine,
which, when thoroughly mixed and cold, dip the cloth in
and hang it up to dry. By this cheap and easy method, muslin,
as well as the strongest cloths, will be rendered impenetrable
to the hardest rains, without the pores being filled up, or
any injury done, when the cloth is colored.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>292. <em>To preserve Furs and Woollens from Moths.</em>&mdash;Let the
former be occasionally combed while in use, and the latter be
brushed and shaken. When not wanted, dry them first, let
them be cool; then mix among them bitter apples from the
apothecary's in small muslin bags, sew the articles in several
folds of linen, carefully turned in at the edges, and keep them
from damp.</p>

<p><em>Or</em>, lay amongst them the cuttings of Russia leather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>293. <em>Or</em>&mdash;Leaves from the tobacco plant are very effectual
in keeping off moths. Lay them between the folds of the
blankets, carpets, &amp;c. Air furs, occasionally.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>294. <em>To prevent Moths.</em>&mdash;In the month of April beat your fur
garments well with a small cane or elastic stick, then lap them
up in linen without pressing the fur too hard, and put between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the folds some camphor in small lumps; then put your furs in
this state in boxes well closed.</p>

<p>When the furs are wanted for use, beat them well as before,
and expose them for twenty-four hours to the air, which will
take away the smell of the camphor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>295. <em>Easy Method of preventing Moths in Furs or Woollens.</em>&mdash;Sprinkle
the furs or woollen stuffs, as well as the drawers or
boxes in which they are kept, with spirits of turpentine; the
unpleasant scent of which will speedily evaporate, on exposure
of the stuffs to the air. Some persons place sheets of paper,
moistened with spirits of turpentine, over, under, or between
pieces of cloth, &amp;c., and find it a very effectual method.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>296. <em>To preserve Furs, Woollens, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;many woollen-drapers
put bits of camphor, the size of a nutmeg, in papers, on different
parts of the shelves in their shops; and as they brush their
cloths every two, three, or four months, this keeps them free
from moths; and this should be done in boxes where furs, &amp;c.,
are put. A tallow candle is frequently put within each muff
when laid by.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>297. <em>To keep Moths, Beetles, etc., from Clothes.</em>&mdash;Put a piece
of camphor in a linen bag, or some aromatic herbs, in the drawers,
among linen or woollen clothes, and neither moth nor worm
will come near them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>298. <em>A celebrated Blacking Cake for Boots and Shoes.</em>&mdash;Take
one part of gum tragacanth, four parts of river water, two parts
of neat's-foot, or some other softening, lubricating oil, two parts
of superfine ivory-black, one part of Prussian blue in fine powder,
or indigo, four parts of brown sugar-candy; boil the mixture;
and when the composition is of a proper consistence, let
it be formed into cakes of such a size that each cake may make
a pint of liquid blacking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>299. <em>Good Blacking for Boots and Shoes.</em>&mdash;Take of ivory
black, one pound; lamp-black, half an ounce; treacle, one pound;
sweet oil, one ounce and a half; coarse gum Arabic, half an
ounce; green copperas, three-quarters of an ounce; and stale
vinegar, three pints and a half. Mix all well together, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
first dissolved the gum in a little water; then add gradually,
briskly stirring the mixture, half an ounce of oil of vitriol; let it
stand two days, occasionally stirring it, and it will be fit for use.</p>

<p>Or, two ounces of ivory-black, one tea-spoonful of oil of vitriol,
a table-spoonful of sweet-oil, and two ounces of sugar-candy,
to be mixed with half a pint of vinegar.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>300. <em>Liquid Blacking.</em>&mdash;Ivory-black, quarter of a pound;
treacle, half a pound, well mixed; to which add sweet oil, one
pennyworth, and small beer three pints; add after, oil of vitriol,
one pennyworth, which will cause it to boil. Fit for use
in three days.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>301. <em>French Polish for Boots and Shoes.</em>&mdash;Logwood chips,
half a pound; glue, quarter of a pound; indigo, pounded very
fine, quarter of an ounce; soft soap, quarter of an ounce; isinglass,
quarter of an ounce; boil these ingredients in two pints
of vinegar and one of water, during ten minutes after ebullition,
then strain the liquid. When cold it is fit for use. To apply
the French polish, the dirt must be washed from the boots and
shoes; when these are quite dry, the liquid polish is put on
with a bit of sponge.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>302. <em>To clean White Satin Shoes.</em>&mdash;Rub them lengthways
of the satin, with a piece of new white flannel dipped in spirits
of wine. If slightly soiled, you may clean them by rubbing
with stale bread.</p>

<p>White satin shoes should be kept in blue paper closely wrapped,
with coarse brown paper outside.</p>

<p>To keep your thin, light slippers in shape, when you put them
away, fold them ever lengthways or sideways, and tie the
strings round them. You should have a covered box purposely
for your shoes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>303. <em>To clean Boot-tops Brown.</em>&mdash;Mix, in the same quantity
of water, one ounce of oxalic acid, half an ounce of muriatic
acid, a small vial of spirits of lavender, and two tea-spoonfuls
of salt of lemon. Each bottle should be carefully labeled and
marked "Poison."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>304. <em>Directions for using the Liquid.</em>&mdash;For the white tops:
to be scrubbed well with a clean hard brush, then <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'spunged'">sponged</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
well with cold water, all one way; and allowed to dry gradually
in the sun, or by the fire.</p>

<p>Brown tops are not to be scrubbed with a brush, but sponged
all over with the mixture, till all stains be removed; then
sponged well with cold water, and rubbed with flannel till they
be highly polished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>305. <em>Shoes.</em>&mdash;When about being measured for shoes, place
the foot firmly on the ground, as the foot is larger in a standing
than in a sitting posture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>306. <em>Shoes.</em>&mdash;One hint about shoes&mdash;a most essential and
expensive article of family wear. However worn and full of
holes the soles may be, if the upper leathers are whole, or
soundly mended, and the stitching firm, the soles may be
covered with the newly adopted article gutta percha, and at a
very small expense the shoes will be rendered as good as new.
We have seen shoes which even the eldest daughter of the
Smith family despised as not worth carrying home, made quite
sound and respectable in appearance, and to serve many months
in constant wear, by being thus soled at the cost of only a few
pence. Thin shoes that have been worn only in-doors, and
which are laid aside on account of the tops becoming shabby,
perhaps worn out, while the sewing is sound, may be made
very tidy by covering with woollen cloth, or with a bit of thick
knitting, or platted list, stitched on as close as possible to the
regular seam.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>307. <em>To prevent Snow-water from penetrating Boots and
Shoes.</em>&mdash;Take equal quantities of bees'-wax and mutton-suet,
and melt them in an earthen pipkin over a slow fire. Lay the
mixture, while hot, over the boots and shoes, which ought also
to be made warm. Let them stand before the fire a short time,
and set them aside till they are cold; then rub them with dry
woollen stuff, so that you may not grease the blacking-brushes.
If you black the shoes before the mixture be put on, they will
afterwards take the blacking much better.</p>

<p>Or, boil together for half an hour, a quart of linseed oil, two
ounces of resin, and half an ounce of white vitriol, and incorporate
with them a quarter of a pint of spirit of turpentine, and
two ounces of well-dried oak sawdust. Lay the mixture on
the soles of the boots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>308. <em>Water-proof Boots.</em>&mdash;A pint of boiled linseed oil, half
a pound of mutton suet, six ounces of clean bees'-wax, and four
ounces of resin, are to be melted and well mixed over a fire.
Of this, while warm, but not hot enough to shrink the leather,
with a brush lay on plentifully over new boots or shoes, when
quite dry and clean. The leather remains pliant. The New
England fishermen preserve their boots water-tight by this
method, which, it is said, has been in use among them above
one hundred years. They can thus stand in water hour after
hour without inconvenience.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>309. <em>Water-proof Boots.</em>&mdash;I have had three pairs of boots
for the last six years (no shoes), and I think I shall not require
any more for the next six years to come. The reason is, that
I treat them in the following manner: I put a pound of tallow
and half a pound of rosin in a pot on the fire; when melted
and mixed, I warm the boots and apply the hot stuff with a
painter's brush, until neither the sole or the upper-leather will
suck in any more. If it is desired that the boots should immediately
take a polish, melt an ounce of wax with a tea-spoonful
of lamp-black. A day after the boots have been treated with
tallow and rosin, rub over them this wax in turpentine, but not
before the fire. The exterior will then have a coat of wax
alone, and will shine like a mirror. Tallow, or any other grease,
becomes rancid, and rots the stitching as well as the leather;
but the rosin gives it an antiseptic quality, which preserves the
whole. Boots and shoes should be so large as to admit of
wearing cork soles.&mdash;<em>Correspondent of Mechanics' Magazine.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>310. <em>To make Cloth or Outer Clothing of any description
Water-proof.</em>&mdash;Take a quarter of an ounce of <em>yellow</em> or <em>Castile</em>
soap, and one gallon of rain water; boil for twenty minutes;
skim, and when cold, put in the cloth or garment; let it remain
soaking twenty-four hours; take it out, and hang to drain;
when half-dry, put it into the following solution:&mdash;Alum, half
a pound; sugar of lead, quarter of a pound; dissolved in four
gallons of rain water. Let the cloth be thoroughly soaked, and
then hang to dry. This process entirely destroys the capillary
attraction in the fibres and threads of the cloth, and the rain or
wet pours off the surface without lodging or penetrating through
the cloth. The solution has <em>no effect</em> in <em>altering</em> the texture or
appearance of the cloth or article immersed. Great care must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
be taken as regards the sugar of lead, not to leave it where
children or any persons ignorant of its qualities can get access
to it, as it is a powerful poison.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>311. <em>To make an Oil-skin Coat or Wrapper.</em>&mdash;If a stout coat
or wrapper is wanted, let the material be strong unbleached or
brown calico. If a light one is preferred, make use of brown
holland. Soak it (when made) in hot water, and hang to dry;
then boil ten ounces of India-rubber in one quart of <em>raw linseed
oil</em>, until dissolved; (this will require about three hours' boiling,)
when cold, mix with the oil so prepared about half a pint
of paint of any color which may be preferred, and of the same
consistency as that used for painting wood. With a paint-brush
lay a thin coat over the outside of the wrapper, brushing
it well into the seams. Hang it to dry in a current of air, but
sheltered from a powerful sun. When <em>thoroughly</em> dry, give it
another coat; dry as before, and then give a third and last coat.
The wrapper, when <em>well dried</em>, will be ready for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>312. <em>To make Gutta Percha Soles.</em>&mdash;The gutta percha possesses
properties which render it invaluable for winter shoes.
<em>It is, compared with leather, a slow conductor of heat</em>; the effect
of this is, that the warmth of the feet is retained, however cold
the surface may be on which the person stands, and that clammy
dampness, so objectionable in the wear of India rubber
shoes, is entirely prevented. On first using gutta percha shoes,
the wearer is forcibly struck with the superior warmth and
comfort which is produced by this non-conducting property;
and I confidently predict, that all those who try gutta percha,
will be steady consumers.</p>

<p>We shall now give the method of fixing the gutta percha
soles. Make the sole of the boot perfectly clean and dry,
scratch it with an awl or a fork until it becomes rough, warm
it before the fire, and spread over it with a hot iron or poker
some of the "solution" sold for this purpose, or in the absence
of this, place some of the thin parings of the gutta percha on
the sole, holding it to the fire, and spreading it as before.
When this has been repeated two or three times, and all is well
covered, warm the gutta percha sole, and the sole of the boot
at the same time, until both become soft and sticky, place the
sole on the boot, and press it down carefully, beginning at the
toe, so as to press out the air and make it adhere closely;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
nothing more remains to be done, than as soon as it becomes
hard to pare the edges with a sharp knife, and trim off as may
be necessary. All the parings and old pieces should be saved,
as gutta percha is not injured by use, and may be sold to the
manufacturer in order to be restored and made up again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>313. <em>Fly Water.</em>&mdash;Most of the fly-waters, and other preparations
commonly sold for the destruction of flies, are variously disguised
poisons, dangerous and even fatal to the human species:
such as solutions of mercury, arsenic, &amp;c., mixed with honey or
syrup. The following preparation, however, without endangering
the lives of children, or other incautious persons, is not less
fatal to flies than even a solution of arsenic. Dissolve two
drachms of the extract of quassia in half a pint of boiling water;
and adding a little sugar or syrup, pour the mixture on plates.
To this enticing food the flies are extremely partial, and it never
fails to destroy them.</p>

<p>A strong infusion of green tea, sweetened, is as effectual in
poisoning flies, as the solution of arsenic generally sold for that
purpose.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>314. <em>To destroy Flies.</em>&mdash;Ground black pepper and moist
sugar, intimately mixed in equal quantities, and diluted with
milk, placed in saucers, adding fresh milk, and stirring the mixture
as often as necessary, succeeds admirably in occasioning
their death.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>315. <em>Another way to destroy Flies.</em>&mdash;Pour a little simple
oxymel (an article sold by druggists) into a common tumbler
glass, and place in the glass a piece of cap paper, made into the
shape of the upper part of a funnel, with a hole at the bottom
to admit the flies. Attracted by the smell, they readily enter
the trap in swarms, and by the thousands soon collected prove
that they have not the wit or the disposition to return.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>316. <em>To remove Flies.</em>&mdash;Flies and other insects may be kept
from attacking meat, by dusting it over with pepper, powdered
ginger, or any other spice, or by skewering a piece of paper to
it on which a drop of creosote has been poured. The spices
may be readily washed off with water before dressing the meat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>317. <em>To keep off Flies.</em>&mdash;Place camphor on or near what you
wish to protect from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>318. <em>Wasps and Flies.</em>&mdash;These insects may be killed immediately
by dipping a feather in a little sweet oil, and touching
their backs with it. When intent on fruit this can easily be
done. Insects of different kinds are readily killed by oil; it
closes up the lateral pores by which they breathe.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>319. <em>To destroy Ants and Wasps.</em>&mdash;Ants are destroyed by opening
the nest and putting in quick-lime, and throwing water on it.</p>

<p>Wasps may be destroyed in the same way; only it will be
requisite that the person who does it should be covered with
muslin, or something over the face, hands, &amp;c., so that the
wasps shall not be able to sting them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>320. <em>To destroy Ants.</em>&mdash;Ants that frequent houses or gardens
may be destroyed by taking flour of brimstone, half a pound,
and potash, four ounces: set them in an iron or earthen pan
over the fire till dissolved and united; afterwards beat them to
a powder, and infuse a little of this powder in water; and wherever
you sprinkle it the ants will die, or fly the place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>321. <em>Another Method.</em>&mdash;Corrosive sublimate, mixed well with
sugar, has proved a mortal poison to them, and is the most effectual
way of destroying these insects.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>322. <em>To destroy Cockroaches, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Stir a small quantity of
arsenic with some bread-crumbs, which lay near the insects'
haunts; meantime, be careful to keep dogs and cats out of the
way. Poisoned wafers are also made for killing cockroaches:
a trap is made with a glass well, for the same purpose; but a
more simple contrivance is to half-fill a glazed basin, or pie-dish,
with sweetened beer or linseed oil, and set in places frequented
by cockroaches. They will attack the <em>red</em> wax of sealed
bottles, but will not touch <em>black</em> wax.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>323. <em>To destroy Crickets.</em>&mdash;To destroy crickets at night, set
dishes or saucers filled with the grounds of beer or tea, on the
kitchen-floor, and, in the morning, the crickets will be found
dead from excess of drinking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>324. <em>To drive away Fleas.</em>&mdash;Sprinkle about the bed a few
drops of oil of lavender, and the fleas will soon disappear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Fumigation with brimstone, or fresh leaves of penny-royal
sewed in a bag, and laid in the bed, will have the desired effect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>325. <em>Liquor for destroying Caterpillars, Ants, and other Insects.</em>&mdash;Take
a pound and three-quarters of soap, the same quantity
of flower of sulphur, two pounds of champignons, or puff-balls,
and fifteen gallons of water. When the whole has been
well mixed, by the aid of a gentle heat, sprinkle the insects
with the liquor, and it will instantly kill them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>326. <em>To destroy Rats.</em>&mdash;Cut a number of corks or a piece of
sponge as thin as sixpences; stew them in grease, and place
them in the way of the rats. They will greedily devour this
delicacy, and will die of indigestion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>327. <em>To kill Rats, another way.</em>&mdash;There are two objections
to the common mode of killing rats, by laying poison for them;
first, the danger to which it exposes other animals and even
human beings; second, the possibility that the rats may cause
an intolerable stench, by dying in their holes. The following
method is free from these objections, and has proved effectual
in clearing houses infested with these vermin.</p>

<p>Oil of amber and ox-gall in equal parts, add to them oatmeal
or flour sufficient to form a paste, which divide into little
balls and lay them in the middle of a room which rats are
supposed or known to visit. Surround the balls with a number
of vessels filled with water. The smell of the oil will be
sure to attract the rats, they will greedily devour the balls,
and becoming intolerably thirsty, will drink till they die on
the spot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>328. <em>To expel Rats.</em>&mdash;Catch one in a trap; muzzle it, with
the assistance of a fellow-servant, and slightly singe some of
the hair; then smear the part with turpentine, and set the animal
loose; if again caught, leave it still at liberty, as the other
rats will shun the place which it inhabits. It is said to be a
fact that a toad placed in a cellar will free it from rats.</p>

<p>Rats may be expelled from cellars and granaries simply by
scattering a few stalks and leaves of mullen in their paths.
There is something very annoying in this plant to the rat. It
affords, therefore, a very easy method of getting rid of a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
perplexing evil, and much more economical and less troublesome
than gunpowder, "rat exterminator," cats, or traps.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>329. <em>To destroy Fleas and other Vermin on Animals.</em>&mdash;To destroy
them on dogs, rub the animal, when out of the house,
with the common Scotch snuff, except the nose and eyes. Rub
the powder well into the roots of the hair. Clear lime-water
destroys the flea-worm without injuring the skin or hair.</p>

<p>Oil of turpentine, when applied to animals, which were
covered with insects, destroyed the insects, without hurting the
animal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>330. <em>To destroy Bugs.</em>&mdash;Mix half a pint of spirits of turpentine
and half a pint of best rectified spirits of wine, in a strong
bottle, and add in small pieces about half an ounce of camphor,
which will dissolve in a few minutes. Shake the mixture well
together; and, with a sponge or brush dipped in it, well wet
the bed and furniture where the vermin breed. This will infallibly
destroy both them and their nits, though they swarm.
The dust, however, should be well brushed from the bedstead
and furniture, to prevent, from such carelessness, any stain. If
that precaution is attended to, there will be no danger of soiling
the richest silk or damask. On touching a live bug with
only the tip of a pin put into the mixture, the insect will be
instantly deprived of existence, and should any bugs happen to
appear after using the mixture, it will only be from not wetting
the linen, &amp;c., of the bed, the foldings and linings of the
curtains near the rings or the joints, or holes in and about the
bed or head-board, in which places the vermin nestle and breed;
so that those parts being well wetted with more of the mixture,
which dries as fast as it is used, and pouring it into the joints
and holes, where the sponge and brush cannot reach, it will
never fail totally to destroy them. The smell of this mixture,
though powerful, is extremely wholesome, and to many persons
very agreeable. It exhales, however, in two or three days.
Only one caution is necessary; but that is important. The
mixture must be well shaken when used; <em>but never applied by
candle light</em>, lest the spirits, being attracted by the flare of the
candle, might cause a conflagration.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>331. <em>Kitchen Cloths.</em>&mdash;The four kinds of cloths requisite for
the kitchen, are knife-cloths, dusters, tea and glass-cloths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Knife-cloths should be made of coarse sheeting. Dusters are
generally made of mixed cotton and linen. The best material
for tea and glass-cloths, is a sheet which has begun to wear thin.</p>

<p>Besides the above cloths, are knife-tray-cloths, house-cloths
for cleaning, pudding and cheese-cloths, and towels.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>332. <em>Clothes' Posts</em> soon decay at the bottom, if left standing
in the ground; but, if fitted into sockets so as to be removable,
they will last for years. The sockets should be made of
one-inch elm, eighteen inches in length, tapering downwards.
When finished, they ought to be about three inches square
inside, at the upper end. They are to be driven firmly into
the earth till just level with the surface. The posts are then
made to drop in and stand firm, and can be taken out, and put
under shelter when not in use. A cover should be fitted to
each socket, to keep litter from falling in when the post is
removed. A drying-ground should not be too much exposed
to the wind, as the violent flapping tears the corners of table-cloths,
sheets, &amp;c., and overblown linen feels flabby after mangling.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>333. <em>Out-houses and Cellars.</em>&mdash;If these have not been recently
cleansed, have them thoroughly cleaned out and white-washed.
A dirty cellar is an abomination, and the fruitful source of
many diseases. Let all your out-buildings have a thorough
overhauling and repairing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>334. <em>To purify Houses.</em>&mdash;An able chemist recommends a
mixture of one pound of chloride of lime in ten gallons of
water. Throw a quart of this daily down the sink or water-closet.
It will not cost five cents a week.</p>

<p>One of the best and most pleasant disinfectants is coffee.
Pound well-dried raw coffee-beans in a mortar, and strew the
powder over a moderately heated iron plate. The simple
traversing of the house with a roaster containing freshly roasted
coffee will clear it of offensive smells.</p>

<h3>HEALTH AND BEAUTY.</h3>

<p class="hsumm"><em>Rules for the preservation of Health, and simple Recipes found
often efficacious in common diseases and slight injuries</em>&mdash;<em>Directions
for preparing Remedies and ministering to the Sick and
Suffering</em>&mdash;<em>The Toilet, or hints and suggestions for the preservation
of Beauty, with some useful Recipes for those who
need them</em>.</p>


<p>335. <em>Means of preserving Health.</em>&mdash;Light and sunshine are
needful for your health. Get all you can; keep your windows
clean. Do not block them up with curtains, plants, or bunches
of flowers: these last poison the air in small rooms.</p>

<p>Fresh air is needful for your health. As often as you can,
open all your windows, if only for a short time, in bad weather;
in fine weather, keep them open, but never sit in draughts.
When you get up, open the windows wide, and throw down
the bed-clothes, that they may be exposed to fresh air some
hours daily before they are made up. Keep your bed-clothes
clean; hang them to the fire when you can. Avoid wearing at
night what you wear in the day. Hang up your day clothes
at night. Except in the severest weather, in small crowded
sleeping-rooms, a little opening at the top of the window-sash
is very important; or, you will find one window-pane of perforated
zinc very useful. You will not catch cold half so easily
by breathing pure air at night. Let not the beds be directly
under the windows. Sleeping in exhausted air creates a desire
for stimulants.</p>

<p>Pure water is needful for your health. Wash your bodies
as well as your faces, rubbing them all over with a coarse cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
If you cannot wash thus every morning, pray do so once a week.
Crying and cross children are often pacified by a gentle washing
of their little hands and faces&mdash;it soothes them. Babies' heads
should be washed carefully, every morning, with yellow soap.
No scurf should be suffered to remain upon them. Get rid of
all slops and dirty water at once, but do not throw them out
before your doors; and never suffer dead cabbage-leaves or dirt
of any kind to remain there; all these poison the air, and bring
fevers. All bad smells are <em>poison</em>; never rest with them.
Keep your back yards clean. Pig-sties are very injurious;
slaughter-houses are equally hurtful: the smells from both
excite typhus fever, and cause ill health. Frederick the Great
said, that one fever was more fatal to him than seven battles.
Disease, and even death, is often the consequence of our own
negligence. Wash your rooms and passages at least once a
week; use plenty of clean water; but do not let your children
stay in them while they are wet&mdash;it may bring on croup or
inflammation of the chest. If you read your Bibles&mdash;which it
is earnestly hoped you do&mdash;you will find how cleanliness, both
as to the person and habitation, was taught to the Jews by God
himself; and we read in the 4th chapter of Nehemiah, that
when they were building their second temple, and defending
their lives against their foes, having no time for rest, they contrived
to put off their clothes for washing. It is a good old
saying, that <em>Cleanliness is next to Godliness</em>. See Heb. x. 22.</p>

<p>Wholesome food is needful for your health. Buy the most
strengthening. Pieces of fresh beef and mutton go the farthest.
Eat plenty of fresh salt with food; it prevents disease. Pray
do not let your children waste their pocket-money in tarts,
cakes, sugar-plums, sour fruit, &amp;c.; they are very unwholesome,
and hurt the digestion. People would often, at twenty years
of age, have a nice little sum of money to help them on in
the world, if they had put in the savings-bank the money so
wasted. Cocoa is cheaper and much more nourishing than tea.
None of these liquids should be taken <em>hot</em>, but lukewarm; when
hot, they inflame the stomach, and produce indigestion. All
kinds of intoxicating drinks are to be avoided, or taken in the
utmost moderation. If possible, abstain from them altogether.
Money saved from drink, will help to educate your children,
and make your homes happier.</p>

<p>We are all made to breathe the pure air of heaven, and therefore
much illness is caused by being constantly in-doors. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
is especially the case with mothers of families, young milliners,
ironers, shoe-makers, tailors, &amp;c. Let such persons make a
point, whenever it is possible, of taking exercise in the <em>open air</em>
for at least an hour and a half, <em>daily</em>. Time would be saved
in the long-run, by the increased energy and strength gained,
and by the warding off of disease.</p>

<p>Be sure to get your children vaccinated, between the third
and sixth month after birth, before teething begins, and when
they are in a good state of health for it. This would save a
great many lives. On no account give your children laudanum,
or any kind of sleeping medicine; numbers are killed by it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>336. <em>Directions in severe Sickness.</em>&mdash;Whenever any one of
your family is taken violently ill, send as soon as possible for
the most skilful physician&mdash;and follow, carefully, his orders.
But, many times, the mother is the best physician, and the
only one needed for her children, if she has been trained to
take proper care of her own health, as every woman should be.
The following recipes and directions may be of great service
to young mothers, and those who have not been accustomed
to minister to the sick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>337. <em>To purify the Chambers of the Sick.</em>&mdash;Close the windows
and doors of the room to be purified, except one door; close
also the chimney aperture, except two or three inches at the
bottom, and remove all the iron and brass furniture; then put
three table-spoonsful of common salt into a dish or pan, place
it upon the floor of the apartment, and pour at once upon the
salt a quarter of a pint of oil of vitriol; retire, and close the
room for forty-eight hours, during which time vapor will continue
to rise and diffuse itself completely through the room, so
as to destroy the matter on which infection depends. The room
may then be entered, the doors and windows thrown open, and
a fire made in the grate, so that the apartment may be perfectly
ventilated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>338. <em>To prevent Infection.</em>&mdash;As a preservative, carry with
you and smell occasionally, a handkerchief sprinkled with this
mixture; half an ounce of spirits of camphor, half a pint of
water, and five ounces of pyroligneous acid.</p>

<p>Cascarilla bark is good to smoke, to prevent the effects of
malaria, and in sick rooms to correct bad effluvia. It yields a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fine aromatic odor, and is very wholesome for sedentary and
studious people to smoke, if mixed with good tobacco. The
proportions for either of these purposes are as follow: one
pound of Turkey tobacco, four ounces of Dutch canister
tobacco, and one ounce of Cascarilla bark, broken small; mix
the above, and smoke a pipe of it every evening, when the
house is shut up; it is also a good digester after meals.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>339. <em>Fumigating Pastilles.</em>&mdash;Pound and mix gum benjamin
and frankincense in powder, of each two drachms; gum
myrrh, storax, cascarilla bark, and nitre, of each, powdered, one
ounce and a half; and charcoal powder, one ounce: moisten,
and shape into pastilles with gum-water, and a very little turpentine.</p>

<p>The stalks of dried lavender, if burnt, have an agreeable
scent, and form a substitute for pastilles; they may be cut
small, and burnt in little vessels.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>340. <em>To use Chloride of Lime.</em>&mdash;This preventive of contagion
may be used as follows: stir one pound of the chloride of lime
into four gallons of water; allow it to settle for a short time,
pour off the clear solution, and keep it in well-corked bottles.</p>

<p>In houses infected, sprinkle the rooms morning and evening
with the above liquid; and pour some of it into shallow dishes
or basins. Sprinkle it about the room and bed-linen occasionally,
and admit fresh air. Infected linen should be dipped in
the mixture about five minutes, and then in common water,
before it is sent to the wash.</p>

<p>A wine-glassful added to the water of a night-chair or bed-pan,
will prevent any smell. To destroy the effluvia from
drains, sewers, cesspools, &amp;c., pour into them a quart of the
mixture, with a pail of water.</p>

<p>Meat sprinkled with, or dipped in the mixture, and hung in
the air, will not be attacked by flies, nor be tainted, for some
time.</p>

<p>Water in cisterns may be purified, and its animalcula killed,
by putting about a pint of the mixture to one hundred gallons
of water.</p>

<p>This mixture will also destroy bugs, if the joints and crevices
of bedsteads be washed with it. It will likewise remove the
smell of paint in a day, if the newly painted room be sprinkled
with it, and if some be placed there in dishes or saucers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>341. <em>Disinfecting Liquid.</em>&mdash;In a wine-bottle full of cold water
dissolve two ounces of sugar of lead, and add two ounces of
aqua-fortis. Shake the mixture well. A very small quantity
of the liquid in its strongest form should be used for cleansing
all chamber utensils. To remove offensive odors, dilute the
liquid with eight or ten parts of water, moisten clean cloths
thoroughly with it, and hang them in various parts of the room.
The offensive gases are neutralized by chemical action. Fumigation
is merely substituting one odor for another. In all
practicable cases, <em>fresh air</em>, and plenty of it, is far the best disinfectant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>342. <em>To prevent Abrasions of the Skin in persons confined to
their beds; a very valuable recipe.</em>&mdash;Apply occasionally to the
tender parts of the body, with a feather, this mixture. Beat to
a strong froth the white of an egg, then drop in gradually,
while beating it, two tea-spoonfuls of spirits of wine. Bottle it
for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>343. <em>To prevent Discolorations of the Skin after a blow or
fall.</em>&mdash;Moisten a little dry starch or arrow-root with cold water,
and lay it on the injured part. It should be done immediately,
so as to prevent the action of the air upon the skin; however,
it may be applied with good effect some hours afterwards. It
is a French receipt, and is quite valuable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>344. <em>A recipe for Neuralgia in the Face.</em>&mdash;Make a lotion with
half a pint of rose-water and two tea-spoonfuls of white vinegar.
Apply it to the part affected, three or four times a-day,
using a fresh linen cloth each time. In two or three days the
pain will pass away. This has been an effectual cure with
many, but as the disease arises from various causes, there is no
specific for it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>345. <em>Eye Water for weak eyes.</em>&mdash;Infuse in boiling water, till
cold, half an ounce of poppy heads, and the same quantity of
chamomile flowers. Strain this mixture, and add two table-spoonfuls
of vinegar, and one of brandy. Apply it warm,
night and morning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>346. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Put into a two-ounce phial fifteen drops of
laudanum, fill it with two-thirds of rose-water, and one-third of
rectified spirits of Mindererus. Use it with a sponge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>347. <em>To cure a Bruise in the Eye.</em>&mdash;Take conserve of red
roses, or a bruised apple, put them in a fold of thin cambric,
apply it to the eye, and it will draw the bruise out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>348. <em>Cold or Inflammation of the Eyes.</em>&mdash;Mix a few bread
crumbs with the white of an egg, put it in a bag of soft muslin,
and apply it to the eye. It will afford relief in a few minutes,
and generally a cure in a day. It is best applied at night, or
when lying down. When removed, bathe the eye well with
warm water, using a bit of muslin, not a sponge.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>349. <em>Carvacrol, the new remedy for the Tooth-ache.</em>&mdash;Dr.
Bushman gives (in the <cite>Medical Times</cite>) the following account of
this new compound, which, though well known in Germany as
a quick and effectual cure for one of the most worrying ills
"that flesh is heir to," is now for the first time published in
England. Carvacrol is an oily liquid, with a strong taste and
unpleasant odor. It may be made by the action of iodine on
oil of caraway or on camphor. A few drops applied on cotton
wool (to a decayed and painful tooth) give immediate relief.
Carvacrol much resembles creosote in appearance, and is used
in similar cases of tooth-ache, but its effect is much more speedy
and certain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>350. <em>To cure Tooth-ache.</em>&mdash;A remedy, often effectual, is to
fill the mouth with warm water, and immediately after with
cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>351. <em>Another cure for Tooth-ache.</em>&mdash;Powdered alum will
not only relieve the tooth-ache, but prevent the decay of the
tooth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>352. <em>Gum-boils.</em>&mdash;A gum-boil is sometimes a primary disease,
depending on an inflammation of the gums from accidental
and common causes, in which case the lancet, or leaving it to
nature, soon restores the gum to a healthy state; but it more
generally arises from a carious tooth, in which case extraction
is necessary. If there be any constitutional disturbance about
the face, leeches and purgatives, and the usual means for subduing
inflammation may be resorted to.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>353. <em>Diseases of the Ear.</em>&mdash;Sometimes ear-ache is connected
with chronic ulceration in the internal and external part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ear&mdash;when injections of warm water and soap are advisable.
In this case, there is sometimes a constant fœtid discharge&mdash;for
which the following mixture has been recommended:&mdash;Mix
three drachms of ox-gall and one drachm of balsam of Peru.
Put a drop on a little cotton in the ear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>354. <em>Temporary Deafness.</em>&mdash;If the ear be inflamed, inject
water into it with a syringe, as warm as the patient can bear it,
and foment the part with the decoction of poppy-heads and
chamomile flowers. Should this not relieve the pain, a drop
of oil of cloves with a little oil of almonds should be dropped
into the ear, and cotton wool put into it. If the ear discharge
much, inject warm water with Castile soap into it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>355. <em>For a Pain in the Ear.</em>&mdash;Oil of sweet almonds, two
drachms, and oil of amber, four drops. Apply four drops of
this mixture, when in pain, to the part affected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>356. <em>Another cure for the Ear-ache.</em>&mdash;Dip a little cotton into
a mixture of oil of sweet almonds and laudanum, and put it
into the ear; or, apply a small poultice, in which is put a raw
chopped clove of garlic; or, roast a small onion, and put as
much of the inside into the ear as you conveniently can.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>357. <em>To kill Earwigs, or other Insects, which may accidentally
have crept into the Ear.</em>&mdash;Let the person under this distressing
circumstance lay his head upon a table, the side upwards that
is afflicted; at the same time, let some friend carefully drop
into the ear a little sweet oil or oil of almonds. A drop or two
will be sufficient, which will instantly destroy the insect and
remove the pain, however violent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>358. <em>Bleeding at the Nose.</em>&mdash;In obstinate cases, blow a little
gum Arabic powder up the nostrils through a quill, which will
immediately stop the discharge.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>359. <em>Another cure for Bleeding at the Nose.</em>&mdash;<em>Elevating the
patient's arm</em> will often have the desired effect. The explanation
is based upon physiological grounds: the greater force required
to propel the blood through the vessels of the arm, when elevated,
causes the pressure upon the vessels of the head to be
diminished, by the increased action which takes place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
course of the brachial arteries. If the theory be sound, both
arms should be elevated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>360. <em>To destroy Corns and Warts.</em>&mdash;Put into an earthen
pipkin a quarter of a pint of linseed oil, to which add one ounce
of resin and a little litharge. Warm them together; spread
them upon leather, and apply them to corns or warts.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>361. <em>To destroy Warts.</em>&mdash;Dissolve as much common washing
soda as the water will take up; wash the warts with this for
a minute or two, and let them dry without wiping. Keep the
water in a bottle, and repeat the washing often. It will remove
the largest warts.</p>

<p>Caustic is an effectual though troublesome application. The
juice of the common annual spurge plant is as efficacious a
remedy; as is the bark of the willow tree, burnt to ashes, mixed
with vinegar, and applied to the warts. The juice of the
marigold is another remedy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>362. <em>A certain cure for Warts.</em>&mdash;Steep in vinegar the inner
rind of a lemon for twenty-four hours, and apply it to the wart.
The lemon must not remain on more than three hours, and
should be applied fresh every day. To apply acetic acid with
a camel's hair-brush, is still better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>363. <em>Corns on the Feet.</em>&mdash;These are usually made by wearing
shoes over-tight; but, walking on pavement in very thin shoes
will cause corns and bunions, because of bruising the feet on
the hard stones.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>364. <em>To prevent Corns from growing on the Feet.</em>&mdash;Easy shoes;
frequently bathing the feet in lukewarm water, with a little salt
or potashes dissolved in it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>365. <em>Sir H. Davy's Corn Solvent.</em>&mdash;Potash, two parts; salts
of sorrel, one part; each in fine powder. Mix, and lay a small
quantity on the corn for four or five successive nights, binding
it on with a rag.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>366. <em>To cure Corns.</em>&mdash;<em>An effectual remedy.</em>&mdash;The cause of
corns, and likewise the torture they occasion, is simply friction;
and to lessen the friction, you have only to use your toe as you
do in like circumstances a coach wheel&mdash;lubricate it with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
oily substance. The best and cleanest thing to use, is a little
sweet oil rubbed on the affected part (after the corn is carefully
pared) with the tip of the finger, which should be done on getting
up in the morning, and just before stepping into bed at
night. In a few days the pain will diminish, and in a few days
more it will cease, when the nightly application may be discontinued.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>367. <em>Another cure for Corns.</em>&mdash;Place the feet for half an hour
for two or three nights successively, in a pretty strong solution
of common soda. The alkali dissolves the indurated cuticle,
and the corn falls out spontaneously, leaving a small excavation,
which soon fills up. This is an almost certain remedy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>368. <em>To cure soft Corns.</em>&mdash;Dip a soft linen rag in turpentine,
and place it over the corn night and morning. In a few
days the corn will disappear. A little sweet oil rubbed on
them is often of great service. Or, a small piece of cotton
placed between the toes is sometimes efficacious; or, the juice
or pulp of a lemon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>369. <em>To cure Bunions in their commencement.</em>&mdash;Bind the joint
tightly, either with broad tape or adhesive plaster. The strip
should be kept on as long as the least uneasiness is felt. It
should wrap quite round the foot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>370. <em>Lotion for Chilblains.</em>&mdash;Mix distilled vinegar and spirit
of mindererus, of each four ounces, with half an ounce of borax.</p>

<p>In common cases of chilblains, apply pieces of soft linen,
moistened with spirits of camphor, soap liniment, camphor liniment,
&amp;c. When the swellings break, apply emollient ointments
for a few days. Equal quantities of sweet oil, lime
water, and spirits of wine, are also an excellent remedy for
chilblains.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>371. <em>Simple remedy for Chilblains.</em>&mdash;Soak them in warm bran
and water, then rub them well with mustard-seed flour; but it
will be better if they are done before they break.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>372. <em>Another remedy.</em>&mdash;Cut an onion in thick slices, and with
these rub the chilblains thoroughly, on two or three nights,
before a good fire, and they will soon disappear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>373. <em>Sir A. Cooper's Chilblain Liniment.</em>&mdash;One ounce of camphorated
spirit of wine, half an ounce of liquid subacetate of
lead; mix, and apply in the usual way three or four times a
day. Some persons use vinegar as a preventive; its efficacy
might be increased, by the addition to the vinegar of one-fourth
of its quantity of camphorated spirit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>374. <em>Note.</em>&mdash;Those who are most liable to chilblains, should,
on the approach of winter, cover the parts most subject to be
affected, with woollen gloves or stockings, and not expose the
hands or feet too much to wet and cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>375. <em>To stop violent Bleeding from a Cut.</em>&mdash;Make a paste,
by mixing fine flour with vinegar, and lay it on the cut.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>376. <em>An excellent Styptic.</em>&mdash;The outside woof of silk-worms
has been tried with great success by several people, more
especially by a lady, who, in mending a pen, cut her thumb
to the bone, and through part of the nail; it bled profusely;
but, by trying this styptic, and binding up the wound, the
hemorrhage stopped, and the wound healed in three days.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>377. <em>A new and useful Styptic.</em>&mdash;Take brandy, or common
spirit, two ounces; Castile soap, two drachms; potash, one
drachm; scrape the soap fine, and dissolve it in the brandy;
then add the potash, and mix it well together, and keep it
close stopped from the air in a phial. When you apply it,
warm it in a vessel, or dip pledges of lint into it, and the blood
will immediately congeal. It operates by coagulating the
blood, both a considerable way within the vessels, as well as
the extravasated blood without, and restraining, at the same
time, the mouths of the vessels.</p>

<p>It forms a valuable embrocation, in cases of tumors or swellings
from bruises, by being frequently rubbed on the part. It
is also used in a similar manner for rheumatic pains.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>378. <em>To prevent Wounds from mortifying.</em>&mdash;Sprinkle sugar
on them. The Turks wash fresh wounds with wine, and sprinkle
sugar on them. Obstinate ulcers may be cured with sugar
dissolved in a strong decoction of walnut leaves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>379. <em>To cure Ring-worms.</em>&mdash;Dissolve borax in water, and
apply it at first, it will produce a burning sensation and redness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
it should then be discontinued for a few days, and being
resumed, the ring-worm will soon disappear.</p>

<p>To sponge the head daily with vinegar and water, in the proportion
of half a pint of vinegar to a pint and a half of water,
will prevent or cure ring-worms.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>380. <em>Another cure for Ring-worms.</em>&mdash;To one part of sulphuric
acid, add about twenty parts of water. Use a brush or feather,
and apply it to the part, night and morning. A very
few dressings will generally cure. If the solution is too strong,
dilute it with more water; and if the irritation is excessive,
rub a little oil or other softening applicant; but avoid soap.</p>

<p>While the patches are in an inflamed and irritable condition,
it is necessary to limit the local applications to regular
washing or sponging with warm water, or some softening fomentation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>381. <em>Cure for Erysipelas.</em>&mdash;A simple poultice made of cranberries,
pounded fine, and applied in a raw state, has proved a
certain remedy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>382. <em>Remedy for fainting.</em>&mdash;First place the patient in the
horizontal posture, throw cold water over the face, and bathe
the hands with vinegar and water; loosen the dress, and admit
a free current of fresh, cool air. Pungent salts, ether, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau
de Cologne</i>, should be held occasionally to the nose, and the
temples should be rubbed with either of the two latter. When
the patient has partly recovered, a small quantity of wine, cold
water, or ten or twenty drops of sal-volatile or ether, in water,
should be given.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>383. <em>Remedy for Fits.</em>&mdash;If a person fall in a fit, let him remain
on the ground, provided his face be pale; for should it be
fainting or temporary suspension of the heart's action, you may
cause death by raising him upright, or by bleeding; but if the
face be red or dark-colored, raise him on his seat, throw cold
water on his head immediately; cold water is the best restorative.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>384. <em>German method of preventing Hysterics.</em>&mdash;Caraway
seeds, finely pounded, with a small proportion of ginger and
salt, spread upon bread and butter, and eaten every day, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
early in the morning, and at night, before going to bed,
are successfully used in Germany, as a domestic remedy
against hysterics.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>385. <em>Stomachic Mixture.</em>&mdash;Camphor julep, one ounce; sweet
spirit of nitre, half an ounce; compound tincture of cardamoms,
spirit of anise-seed, of each five drachms; oil of caraway, twelve
drops; syrup of ginger, two drachms; peppermint-water, two
drachms. Mix. A table-spoonful occasionally in flatulency
and dyspepsia.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>386. <em>Red lavender drops for Nervous Attacks.</em>&mdash;Fill a quart
bottle with the blossoms of lavender, and pour on it as much
brandy as it will contain; let it stand ten days, then strain it,
and add of nutmeg bruised, cloves, mace, and cochineal, a quarter
of an ounce each, and bottle it for use. In nervous cases,
a little may be taken dropped on a bit of sugar; and in the
beginning of a bowel complaint, a tea-spoonful, taken in half a
glass of peppermint water, will often prove efficacious.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>387. <em>Eggs in Jaundice.</em>&mdash;The yolk of an egg, either eaten
raw, or slightly boiled, is perhaps the most salutary of all the
animal substances. It is a natural soap, and, in all jaundice
cases no food is equal to it. When the gall is either too weak,
or, by accidental means, is not permitted to flow in sufficient
quantity into the duodenum, our food, which consists of watery
and oily parts, cannot unite so as to become chyle. Such is
the nature of the yolk of an egg, that it is capable of uniting
water and oil into an uniform substance, thereby making up
for the deficiency of natural bile.&mdash;<em>Dr. A. Hunter.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>388. <em>Aperient for Children.</em>&mdash;Gingerbread made with oatmeal
instead of flour, is a very useful aperient for children.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>389. <em>Cramp.</em>&mdash;Cramp in the calves of the legs is a very disagreeable
complaint, to which those who have their legs confined
in tight boots are subject in travelling. An effectual preventative
of this pain, is to stretch out the heel of the leg as far
as possible, at the same time drawing up the toes towards the
body.</p>

<p>A garter applied tightly round the limb affected will, in most
cases, speedily remove this complaint. When it is more obstinate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a brick should be heated, wrapped in a flannel bag, and
placed at the foot of the bed, against which the person troubled
may place his feet. <em>No remedy, however, is equal to that of diligent
and long-continued friction.</em></p>

<p>Cramp is apt to attack the calves of the legs and toes soon
after retiring to rest. Get out of bed, and exercise the muscles
vigorously.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>390. <em>For Spasms.</em>&mdash;Mix four table-spoonsful of camphor julep
and twenty drops of sal-volatile, for a dose, to be repeated
twice or thrice a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>391. <em>To apply Leeches.</em>&mdash;Make the part clean and dry, and
dry the leeches in a clean cloth; if this fail, scratch the surface
of the skin with a point of a lancet, and apply the leech on the
spot, moistened with the blood. To apply a number of leeches,
put them into a very small wine-glass, which hold over them till
they are fixed. If the skin be much inflamed and heated, pour
a little tepid water into the water containing the leeches, before
they are taken out to be applied. If sulphur be taken internally,
or applied externally, leeches will not bite; neither will
they bite if the skin be covered with perspiration; or if there
be tobacco smoke or vinegar-vapor in the room.</p>

<p>All that is requisite to stop the bleeding, after the leech is
taken away, is constant pressure on the spot; a piece of sponge
or cotton, the size of a pin's head, is to be put upon the aperture,
and kept there by cross slips of adhesive plaster spread
upon linen, or the surgeon's strapping: if greater pressure be
necessary, some linen may be placed between the stopper and
the plaster.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>392. <em>A useful embrocation for Rheumatism, Lumbago, or
Strains.</em>&mdash;Half an ounce of strongest camphorated spirit, one
ounce spirits of turpentine, one raw egg, half pint best vinegar.
Well mix the whole, and keep it closely corked. To be rubbed
in three or four times a day. For rheumatism in the head, or
face-ache, rub all over the back of the head and neck, as well
as the part which is the immediate seat of pain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>393. <em>For Gout and Rheumatism.</em>&mdash;Mix in one pound of
honey one ounce of flour of sulphur, half an ounce of cream of
tartar, two drachms of ginger, in powder, and half a nutmeg,
grated: for rheumatism, add half a drachm of gum-guaiacum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
powdered. The full dose is two tea-spoonsful at bed-time and
early in the morning, in a tumbler of hot water. This is "the
Chelsea Pensioners' recipe."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>394. <em>Influenza.</em>&mdash;Influenza is an Italian word, and means
what we express in English by almost the same word, influence.
The word as applied to this disease, originated from the belief
held by our ancestors, of the influence of the stars upon human
affairs. When a complaint suddenly appeared, and affected
great numbers without an obvious cause, the visitation was
ascribed to the stars. Whatever might have been the origin
of the name, it is an appropriate one, for the Influenza certainly
springs from some pervading influence. It may, for anything
we can prove to the contrary, be occasioned by some subtle
poison diffused throughout the atmosphere, which medical men
call a <em>miasm</em>. Bad air, rising from marshy ground, occasions
ague; and bad air arising from drains in towns, from cess-pools,
and other collections of filth, gives rise to the worst kinds of
fever. And it is not a matter of chance: the ague will continue
in marshy countries till these are drained; and in the dirty
quarters of a large town, there is sure to be typhus fever. If
we cannot, in these cases, see, taste, or touch the bad air, or
even smell it, we know that fens poison the air with a matter
that causes ague, and animal refuse with what causes fever and
many other diseases. But, the existence of a peculiar poison
in the air in influenza, is very doubtful. It is likely, however,
and generally believed by medical men, that influenza arises
from certain states or changes in the air connected with heat
and moisture. Now, though it appears in hot weather and
cold, in dry and wet, it may still depend on certain conditions
of the weather, just as a person will sometimes take a cough
in a warm moist day, and again in a dry east wind; and just,
in fact, as we see a fog, which depends on atmospheric changes,
produced under different circumstances. The brisk air of the
country often gives town-people a head-cold, and country people
sometimes suffer in the same way when they visit town. During
every season, certain people have "head-colds," coughs,
and "feverish colds." These are produced by certain states
of climate acting on certain states of constitution. At particular
seasons such complaints abound&mdash;at others they abound still
more; and again, from some singularity, they prevail so much,
that people say, there is an <em>Influenza</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>In simple cases, confinement to a pure and temperate air,
warm drinks, and a warm bath, or at least a warm foot-bath,
with an extra blanket, and a little more rest than usual, keeping
to mild food and toast and water, and taking, if necessary,
a dose of aperient medicines&mdash;is all that is required. In serious
cases, the domestic treatment must become professional. Mustard
plasters to the back, relieve the head-ache. Squills, and
other medicines, "loosen" the outstanding cough. Bark and
wine, and even cold baths, are sometimes requisite for the
weakness left behind. But these things can only be used with
discrimination by a regular professional man.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>395. <em>For the Breath.</em>&mdash;Persons who suffer from difficulty of
breathing and oppression on the chest, will find great relief
from the following simple contrivance. A tea-kettle is to be
kept boiling, either over a fire or over a common night-lamp
or nursing-candlestick. A tin tube is to be fitted on to the
spout of the tea-kettle, of such length and form as to throw
the steam in front of the sick person, who will then breathe
in it. This prevents the distressing sensation occasioned by
inhaling the cold night air, which will be felt by persons suffering
from asthma or water on the chest, and which is not obviated
either by clothing or fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>396. <em>To relieve Asthma.</em>&mdash;Soak some blotting-paper in a strong
solution of saltpetre; dry it, take a piece about the size of your
hand, and on going to bed, light it, and lay it upon a plate in
your bed-room. By doing so, persons, however badly afflicted
with asthma, will find that they can sleep almost as well as
when in health. (Many persons have experienced relief from
the use of this specific.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>397. <em>Relief for Asthma&mdash;another way.</em>&mdash;Mix two ounces of
the best honey with one ounce of castor oil, and take a tea-spoonful,
night and morning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>398. <em>Gargle for Sore Throat.</em>&mdash;On twenty-five or thirty leaves
of the common sage, pour a pint of boiling water; let the
infusion stand half an hour. Add vinegar enough to make it
moderately acid, and honey to the taste. Use it as a gargle,
several times a day. This combination of the astringent and
emollient principle seldom fails to produce the desired effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>399. <em>To prevent Lamps from being pernicious to Asthmatic
persons, or others liable to Complaints of the Chest.</em>&mdash;Let a sponge,
three or four inches in diameter, be moistened with pure water,
and in that state be suspended by a string or wire, exactly
over the flame of the lamp, at the distance of a few inches;
this substance will absorb all the smoke emitted during the
evening or night; after which, it should be rinsed in warm
water, by which means it will be again rendered fit for use.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>400. <em>The use of Tar-water in expanding the Lungs of Public
Speakers, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;It has been found by the experience of many,
that drinking tar-water very much deterges and opens the
lungs, and thereby gives a very sensibly greater ease in speaking.
A quart of tar is to be stirred six minutes in a gallon of
water; but if there be somewhat less tar, it may do as well,
especially at first, to try how it sits on the stomach. Take
about one-fourth of a pint, at four several times, at a due distance
from meals. Begin taking it in the spring for about
fourteen days, and continue it for a greater length of time, as
occasion may require.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>401. <em>To prevent Danger from Wet Clothes.</em>&mdash;Keep if possible
in motion, and take care not to go near a fire or into any very
warm place, so as to occasion a sudden heat, till some time
after you have been able to procure dry clothes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>402. <em>Cold and Damp Feet.</em>&mdash;Nothing can be more erroneous
than the notion that by pouring spirits into boots and shoes,
when the feet are wet, will prevent the effects of cold; on the
contrary, the practice often produces cold, inflammation, and
obstruction in the bowels. When the spirit reaches the feet, it
immediately evaporates: the stronger it is, the more quickly it
evaporates, and the greater is the cold produced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>403. <em>For Whooping Cough.</em>&mdash;Mix two tea-spoonfuls of paregoric
elixir, one table-spoonful of oxymel of squills, and the
same quantity of water and mucilage of gum-arabic. A tea-spoonful
may be taken three or four times a-day, or when
the cough is troublesome.</p>

<p>Treat the whooping cough with the same care as you would
any other cough. Keep the children warmly clothed, and dryly
lodged, and in the house, at all times, except in warm sunny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
days, when air and exercise in moderation, observing that they
do not overheat themselves, may do good. Put their feet in a
pan of warm water just before they go to bed, and be careful
to wipe them dry and wrap them in flannel. During the day
they must wear woollen stockings and thick-soled shoes. Let
their drink be toast-water, tea and raspberry vinegar mixed
with water, two table-spoonfuls to a half-pint, or less if it be
very sharp. Red or black currant-jelly dissolved in water
makes a pleasant, cool drink. Be sure you give no kind of
quack medicines&mdash;but an occasional dose of simple opening
medicine, if the bowels are confined; and a quarter of a grain,
or half a grain of plain ipecacuanha powder in a tea-spoonful of
gruel or jelly at bed-time. Rub the chest and between the
shoulders, with equal parts of rum and turpentine, adding a little
oil, if it is too harsh for the skin. The child might suck an
ipecacuanha lozenge two or three times a-day. Effervescent,
saline draughts are very grateful and beneficial, where there is
not only continual nausea, but frequent sickness from the
spasmodic nature of the cough. If it be attended with pain in
the chest or side, seek advice from a medical man without
delay.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>404. <em>For common Coughs.</em>&mdash;Mix one ounce of oil of almonds,
one drachm of powdered gum arabic, one ounce of syrup, and
one ounce and a half of water; take a tea-spoonful or two occasionally.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>405. <em>Winter Cough.</em>&mdash;Mix two ounces of oxymel of stramonium
with six ounces of the decoction of Iceland moss; take
a dessert-spoonful when the cough is troublesome.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>406. <em>For Cough and Hoarseness.</em>&mdash;Beat well a newly laid
egg, and stir it into a quarter of a pint of new milk, warmed,
to which add a table-spoonful of capillaire.</p>

<p>A piece of anchovy will almost instantly restore the just
tone of voice to any one who has become hoarse by public
speaking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>407. <em>White Mixture for Coughs.</em>&mdash;Beat well the yolk of an
egg, mix with it in a mortar half a drachm of powdered
spermaceti, a little loaf sugar and twenty drops of laudanum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
(tincture of opium); add a gill of water, and mix well: a
table-spoonful of this mixture will relieve an obstinate cough.</p>

<p>Or, mix half a pint of almond emulsion, two drachms of
syrup of poppies, the same of oxymel of squills, and one
drachm of powder of gum tragacanth; two table-spoonfuls to
be taken often.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>408. <em>Colds.</em>&mdash;A daily exposure to the outward air is absolutely
necessary to secure us against the injurious influence of
our variable climate. For cure of catarrh, reduce the amount
of food, take exercise, keep the bowels open, and bathe the feet
in warm water at bed-time.&mdash;<em>Henderson.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>409. <em>For a Cold in the Head.</em>&mdash;What is called a head-bath
is useful. Fill a wash-hand basin with boiling water, and add
an ounce of flour of mustard; then hold the head, covered with
a cloth to prevent the escape of the steam, over the basin as
long as any steam arises.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>410. <em>For a troublesome Cough.</em>&mdash;Take of treacle and the best
white wine vinegar six table-spoonfuls each; add forty drops of
laudanum; mix it well, and put it into a bottle. A tea-spoonful
to be taken occasionally when the cough is troublesome.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>411. <em>For a sudden Hoarseness.</em>&mdash;Mix one tea-spoonful of
sweet spirits of nitre in a wine-glassful of water. This may be
taken two or three times a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>412. <em>Hoarseness.</em>&mdash;A piece of flannel, dipped in brandy, and
applied to the chest, and covered with a dry flannel, is to be
worn all night. Four or six small onions, boiled, and put on
buttered toast, and eaten for supper, are likewise good for colds
on the chest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>413.&mdash;<em>Children's Coughs.</em>&mdash;A few tea-spoonfuls of warm
treacle taken occasionally, and particularly at bed-time, or
when the cough is troublesome, will be found beneficial, especially
for infants and children.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>414. <em>For a "hacking" Cough.</em>&mdash;Dissolve an ounce of mutton
suet in a pint of milk, and drink it warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>415. <em>For a Cough.</em>&mdash;Mix vinegar and treacle in equal quantities,
and let a tea-spoonful be taken occasionally, when the
cough is troublesome. This is the recipe of Dr. James, of
Carlisle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>416. <em>Quinsy, or Ulcerated Sore Throat.</em>&mdash;Bake or roast three
or four large onions or six smaller ones, till soft. Peel them
quickly, and beat them flat with a rolling-pin or glass bottle.
Then put them immediately in a thin muslin bag that will
reach from ear to ear, and about three inches deep. Apply it
speedily, and as warm as possible, to the throat. Keep it on
day and night, changing it when the strength of the onions appears
to be exhausted, and substituting fresh ones. Flannel
must be worn round the neck after the poultice is removed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>417. <em>Saline Draught.</em>&mdash;Dissolve one scruple of carbonate of
potassa, (salt of tartar), in a table-spoonful of lemon-juice, and
three table-spoonfuls of water; sweeten with lump sugar, and
drink while it effervesces. This is an excellent remedy for
sore throats, nausea, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>418. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Dissolve one drachm each of nitric acid and
carbonate of potassa in three-quarters of a pint of water; add
one ounce each of syrup of orange-peel and spirit of nutmeg,
and mix. Two table-spoonfuls to be taken in fevers and inflammatory
sore throats.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>419. <em>To make Gargles.</em>&mdash;For relaxed sore throat, mix five
ounces of Cayenne pepper gargle, two ounces of infusion of
roses, and one ounce of syrup of roses.</p>

<p>Or, mix with the Cayenne pepper gargle, three ounces of
vinegar, three drachms of tincture of myrrh, and four drachms
of honey of roses.</p>

<p>For inflammatory sore throats, mix six ounces of infusion of
roses, one ounce of tincture of myrrh, and one ounce of honey
of roses.</p>

<p>Or, mix one drachm and a half of saltpetre, two ounces of
honey, and six ounces of rose-water.</p>

<p>For scorbutic gums, mix six ounces of infusion of roses, one
ounce of borax, and one ounce of honey of roses.</p>

<p>To make the Cayenne pepper gargle, pour six ounces of boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
water upon one scruple of Cayenne pepper; cover it, and
let it stand for three hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>420. <em>To cure Hiccough.</em>&mdash;This is caused by flatulency, indigestion,
and acidity. It may be relieved generally by a sudden
fright or surprise, or any sudden application of cold; also by
drinking cold water slowly; eating a small piece of ice, taking
a pinch of snuff, or anything that excites coughing. Or, take
one tea-spoonful of common vinegar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>421. <em>A simple cure for Dysentery&mdash;which has never failed.</em>&mdash;Take
some butter off the churn, immediately after being churned,
just as it is, without being salted or washed; clarify it over
the fire like honey. Skim off all the milky particles when
melted over a clear fire. Let the patient (if an adult) take two
table-spoonfuls of the clarified remainder, twice or thrice within
the day. This has never failed to effect a cure, and in many
cases it has been almost instantaneous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>422. <em>For Diarrhœa.</em>&mdash;Fill a tea-cup with dry flour, press it
down, and cover it with a buttered cloth, tying it very closely;
boil it three hours, when turn it out to cool into a hard mass.
Grate a tea or a dessert-spoonful of it into peppermint water
for children, or into a glass of port wine for adults.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>423. <em>Chalk Mixture.</em>&mdash;Mix half an ounce of prepared chalk,
the same of lump sugar, and one ounce of powdered gum
Arabic, with a pint of water. This is an excellent remedy for
diarrhœa.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>424. <em>Fig Paste for Constipation.</em>&mdash;Cut up small one pound
of figs, and mix it with two ounces of senna carefully picked
over, and one tea-cupful of molasses; stew it till it becomes
thoroughly mixed and firm; then cool it. A piece about half
as large as a fig will generally be sufficient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>425. <em>Laxatives.</em>&mdash;Infusions of Epsom salts and senna are
often taken as laxatives, or opening medicines. It is a well-known
fact, that a tea-spoonful of salts in a tumbler of cold
water, if drunk before breakfast, is as effectual a dose as the
usual ounce. Senna, too, if steeped in cold water, is equally
efficacious, and free from the nauseous bitter taste which it has
when infused in boiling water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>426. <em>To cure Boils.</em>&mdash;Boil in half a pint of milk one table-spoonful
of shot; pour it off, and drink it in small doses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>427. <em>To cure a Felon.</em>&mdash;A felon generally appears on the
end of the fingers or thumbs; it is extremely painful for weeks,
and sometimes for months, and, in most cases, cripples or disfigures
the finger or thumb that falls a victim to it. But it
can easily be cured, if attended to in time. As soon as the
pain is felt, take the thin white skin of an egg, which is found
inside next to the shell; put it round the end of the finger or
thumb affected, and keep it there until the pain subsides. As
soon as the skin becomes dry, it will be very painful, and
likely continue so for half an hour or more; but be not alarmed.
If it grows painful, bear it; it will be of short duration in comparison
to what the disease would be. A cure will be certain.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>BURNS AND SCALDS.</h4>

<p>428. We mention several remedies which have obtained
popular reputation in these accidents, and which are valuable
not only as giving more or less relief, but as being generally
at hand, or to be readily procured in every dwelling. They
are, wheat flour, which may be thickly sprinkled over the
injured parts with a common kitchen dredger, till a perfect
crust is formed&mdash;an excellent application. Finely-scraped
chalk or magnesia, applied in the same way. These act both
by excluding the atmospheric air, and absorbing the fluid secreted
by the vessels of the inflamed surface. Another application
reported to be very efficacious in allaying the pain, is a
piece of lint wetted with a saturated solution of carbonate of
soda. A poultice of grated raw turnip or potato, applied cold,
is quickly productive of ease in slight burns, but requires renewing
often enough to keep up the sensation of coldness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>429. <em>Burns.</em>&mdash;Apply to, or wrap round the burnt part, some
folds of cotton bought in sheets; however severe the pain may
be, it will abate in a few hours. Should blisters arise, they
may next day be carefully pricked with a needle, so as to break
the skin as little as possible; and the cotton kept on till the
cure is effected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>430. <em>A remedy for a Burn or Scald.</em>&mdash;Apply immediately a
thick covering of wool to the burnt part, and bind it on tight;
in the course of half an hour very little pain will be felt, and
scarcely any blister will remain. As this remedy is so simple,
no housekeeper should be without loose wool at hand, in case
of an accident. This remedy was discovered by the child of a
woolcomber having been dreadfully scalded: its mother laid it
in a basket of newly carded wool, whilst she ran for a doctor;
when she returned, she found the child fast asleep amongst the
wool, and when it awoke the excessive pain had subsided. We
have frequently tried it, and invariably with success.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>431. <em>For Burns and Scalds.</em>&mdash;Plunge the injured part into
cold spring or ice water; or, lay on it pounded ice wrapped
in linen.</p>

<p>Or, dissolve four ounces of alum in a quart of hot water;
dip a cloth into it, and lay it on the part. As soon as it becomes
hot and dry, repeat the application.</p>

<p>Apply to a burn, bruise, or cut, the moist surface of the
inside coating of the shell of a raw egg; it will adhere of itself,
and heal without pain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>432. <em>Efficacy of Vinegar in curing Burns and Scalds.</em>&mdash;Vinegar
is a great antiseptic and corrector of putrescence and mortification.
The progressive tendency of burns of the unfavorable
kind, or those that are ill-treated, is to putrescence and mortification.
When the outward skin is not broken, it may be freely
used every hour or two; where the skin is broken, and if it
gives pain, it must be gently used. But, equal parts of tepid
vinegar and water applied every three or four hours, is the
best rule to be directed by.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>433. <em>Vitriol Accidents.</em>&mdash;For a burn by vitriol, or any similar
cause, lay on, with a feather, the white of eggs mixed with
powdered chalk, and immediate relief will follow.</p>

<p>Or, immediately after the accident, plunge the scalded limb
in spirit of turpentine, and keep it there a few minutes.</p>

<p>Or, dissolve in water or fresh soap-boilers' lees, a little soda
or potash, and apply it instantly, and it will prevent all injury
to the person or clothing.</p>

<p>FEVERS.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>434. Feverish symptoms in young children may be reduced,
and often entirely cured by sponging in tepid or cold water,
according to the age and condition of the patient. Rest, in a
clean bed, after sponging, is necessary. Should the fever continue,
a gentle emetic may be given. Cold water is the best
beverage in fevers, but if very thirsty, give the child a little
warm tea.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>435. <em>Dr. Dickson's cure for a Fever.</em>&mdash;When a man is hot,
and his skin dry all over, no matter what the cause be, you
may bring his condition to the state of health by throwing cold
water over him. You may do the same by an emetic. Oh!
an emetic has a wonderful power in fever; and the old physicians
treated all fevers in the first instance by emetics. They
did not trouble themselves much about the cause. The <em>state</em>
of the patient was what they cared most about. When he was
cold, they warmed him, sometimes with one thing, sometimes
with another. When hot, they cooled him; not in the Sangrado
fashion of these days, by draining him of his life's blood;
but by the employment of an emetic, or by sponging him over
with cold water!</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>436. <em>Easy and almost instantaneous cure for the Fever and
Ague.</em>&mdash;An hour or two before the fit comes on, take a new-laid
egg, in a glass of vinegar or brandy, and go to bed immediately.</p>

<p>This very simple recipe has cured a great many, after more
celebrated preparations have proved unsuccessful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>437. <em>Cure for Yellow Fever.</em>&mdash;The New Orleans Tropic
gives the following recipe, which is said to be used with great
success in Mexico, in cases of yellow fever: "A tumbler two-thirds
full of olive oil, well mixed with the juice of <em>two limes</em>,
and a tea-spoonful of fine table salt, is the common remedy in
that country; that he has seen it used in hundreds of cases,
many of them the most desperate he ever saw, and that he never
knew it fail to produce a cure in a solitary instance! It sometimes
causes the patient to vomit; in such cases it should be
repeated until the stomach will retain it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>438. <em>Treatment of Scarlet Fever&mdash;important prescription.</em>&mdash;Dr.
Lindsly, of Washington, strongly recommends the mode of
treatment of scarlet fever, resorted to by Dr. Schneemann,
physician to the King of Hanover. It is as follows, and exceedingly
simple:</p>

<p><em>Treatment of Scarlet Fever by inunction.</em>&mdash;From the first day
of the illness, and as soon as we are certain of its nature, the
patient must be rubbed morning and evening over the whole
body with a piece of bacon, in such a manner that, with the
exception of the head, a covering of fat is everywhere applied.
In order to make this rubbing-in somewhat easier, it is best to
take a piece of bacon the size of the hand, choosing a part still
armed with the rind, that we may have a firm grasp. On the
soft side of this piece slits are to be made, in order to allow the
oozing out of the fat. The rubbing must be thoroughly performed,
and not too quickly, in order that the skin may be regularly
saturated with the fat. The beneficial results of the
application are soon obvious; with a rapidity bordering on
magic, all, even the most painful symptoms of the disease are
allayed; quiet, sleep, good humor, appetite, return; and there
remains only the impatience to quit the sick room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>439. <em>Inflammatory Fevers.</em>&mdash;In diseases termed "inflammatory,"
what measure so ready or so efficacious as to dash a
pitcher or two of cold water over the patient&mdash;<em>Cold Affusion</em>,
as it is called? Whilst serving in the army, I cured hundreds
of inflammatory fevers in this manner&mdash;fevers, that, in the
higher ranks of society, under the bleeding and starving systems&mdash;would
have kept an apothecary and physician&mdash;to say
nothing of nurses and cuppers&mdash;visiting the patient twice or
thrice a day for a month, if he happened to live so long.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, with the cold dash you may easily,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While others meanly take whole months to slay,</span>
<span class="i0"> &nbsp; Produce a cure in half a summer's day."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Dickson.</span></span>
</div></div>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>440. <em>Beverage for Fevers.</em>&mdash;Boil two drachms of powdered
alum in a pint of milk, and strain. The draught is a wine-glassful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>441. <em>Mustard Poultices.</em>&mdash;Make a bag of the size required
of fine, close muslin; mix equal quantities of mustard and flour,
(or a larger proportion of mustard, should the case require it),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with boiling water, until of a proper consistency. Fill the bag
with it; sew it up, and, covering it with a handkerchief or piece
of clean, soft linen, apply it to the part affected. When it has
been on long enough, take it off, and lay on another piece of
soft linen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>442. <em>Bread Poultice.</em>&mdash;Mr. Abernethy directs a bread and
water poultice to be made as follows:&mdash;Put half a pint of hot
water into a pint basin; add to this as much of the crumb of
bread as the water will cover, then place a plate over the basin,
and let it remain about ten minutes; stir the bread about in
the water, or, if necessary, chop it a little with the edge of a
knife, and drain off the water, by holding the knife on the top
of the basin, but do not press the bread as is usually done;
then take it out lightly, spread it about one-third of an inch
thick on some soft linen, and lay it upon the part. If it be a
wound, you may place a bit of lint dipped in oil beneath the
poultice. There is nothing better than the bread poultice for
broken surfaces.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>443. <em>Linseed Poultice.</em>&mdash;Is made by simply mixing linseed
meal into a paste with hot water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>444. <em>Management of Blisters.</em>&mdash;Spread the plaster thinly on
paper or linen, and rub over it a few drops of olive oil. In
this way the blister acts speedily, and with less irritation than
usual.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>445. <em>Simple Ointment.</em>&mdash;This is made by melting in a pipkin,
by the side of the fire, without boiling, one part of yellow
or white wax, and two parts of hog's lard or olive oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>446. <em>Spermaceti Ointment.</em>&mdash;This consists of a quarter of an
ounce of white wax, three-quarters of an ounce of spermaceti,
and three ounces of olive oil, melted as before. This is the
common dressing for a blister.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>447. <em>Elder-flower Ointment.</em>&mdash;This is the mildest, blandest,
and most cooling ointment which can be used; and it is very
suitable for anointing the face or neck when sun-burnt. It is
made of fresh elder-flowers, stripped from the stalks, two pounds
of which are simmered in an equal quantity of hog's-lard till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
they become crisp; after which, the ointment, whilst fluid, is
strained through a coarse sieve.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>448. <em>Calamine Ointment, or Turner's Cerate.</em>&mdash;This consists
of half a pound of yellow wax and a pint of olive oil, which are
to be melted together; this being done, half a pound of calamine
powder is to be sifted in, and stirred till the whole be
completely mixed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>449. <em>Sulphur Ointment.</em>&mdash;This is made by rubbing well together
three ounces of flowers of sulphur and half a pound of
hog's lard. This ointment, if properly applied, is a certain
cure for that nastiest of all nasty, and most easily-caught disease,
the itch, which, although generally found among poor
people, occasionally steals into the houses of the wealthy. The
proper mode of managing it is, for the infected to rub himself
well all over with the ointment, night and morning, for three
days, during which time he must wear, without change, some
old body-linen, stockings, and gloves, and lie in a pair of old
sheets or blankets. Washing in the least degree is to be carefully
avoided as the plague, for it will protract the cure. On
the fourth day let him go into a warm bath, wash himself
clean, and he will then be found quite well. Everything which
had been worn during the cure should be burnt, sheets and all;
but the blankets may be scoured.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>PLASTERS, BLISTERS, OINTMENTS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>450. The beneficial influence obtained from all such local applications
depends upon the change of temperature they are
capable of producing. Their results will vary with constitutions.
Most patients, who suffer from chronic disease, point to
a particular spot as the locality where they are most incommoded
with "cold chills." This is the point for the application
of the galbanum or other "warm plaster." A plaster of this
kind to the loins has enabled me to cure a host of diseases that
had previously resisted every other mode of treatment. The
same application to the chest, when the patient complained of
chilliness in that particular part, has materially aided me in the
treatment of many cases of phthisis. In both instances, where
<em>heat</em> was the more general complaint, cold sponging has been
allowed by an equally beneficial effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The ingredients of plasters, blisters, ointments, lotions, &amp;c.,
what are they but combinations of the agents with which we
combat fever? Their beneficial influence depends upon the
change of motion and temperature which they produce by their
electrical or chemical action on the nerves of the part to which
they are directed. Cantharides will not blister the dead&mdash;they
have very little effect even on a dying man!&mdash;<em>Dr. Dickson's
Lectures.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>451. <em>Liquid Opodeldoc.</em>&mdash;Dissolve one ounce of camphor in
a little spirits of wine, and two ounces of soft soap in a little
water; put these into a bottle, add half a drachm of oil of rosemary
and the same of oil of thyme; shake them well together;
add three-quarters of a pint of spirits of wine, and a quarter of
a pint of water; set it in a warm place, and shake it occasionally,
for a few days. This is an excellent remedy for bruises,
sprains, chilblains, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>452. <em>Extract of Arnica, for Bruises, Sprains, Burns, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Take
one ounce of arnica flowers, dried; that prepared by the
Shakers is considered the best; and put them in a wide-mouthed
bottle; pour just enough scalding water over them to moisten
them, and afterwards about a pint or a pint and a half of spirits
of wine. In case of a burn or bruise, &amp;c., wet a cloth in the
arnica and lay it on the part affected. Renew the application
occasionally, and the pain will soon be removed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>453. <em>For a Sprain.</em>&mdash;Mix equal parts of spirit of camphor,
distilled vinegar, and turpentine, and rub the part affected.</p>

<p>Cold water applications are excellent for sprains; as, to
bathe the part in cold water, to pour cold water upon it, or to
put bandages wet in cold water around it.</p>

<p>Extract of arnica, applied to a sprain, will remove the pain
in a short time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>454. <em>Contusions or Bruises.</em>&mdash;In slight bruises, and those not
likely to be followed by much inflammation, nothing more is
usually necessary than to bathe the part in cold water, or with
spirit, as eau de Cologne, brandy, &amp;c., mixed with an equal
proportion of vinegar and water. In more severe cases, however,
and where the accident is near an important part, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
eye, or any of the joints, it becomes a desirable object to prevent
the approach of inflammation. This is to be attempted
by the application of leeches, repeating them according to circumstances;
purgatives and a low diet may become necessary.
In the last stage of a bruise, where there is merely a want of
tone in the parts, and swellings from the effused blood, &amp;c.,
friction should be employed, either simply, or with any common
liniment, as opodeldoc. Wearing a bandage, pumping
cold water on the part, succeeded by warm friction, also a saturated
solution of common salt in water, have each been found
beneficial. The roots of bryony and Solomon's seal, bruised
and applied as a poultice, are efficacious in hastening the disappearance
of the lividity of bruises.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>455. <em>Lime Water.</em>&mdash;Pour three quarts of water upon eight
pounds of unslaked lime; let stand half an hour, when add
three gallons of water, and pour it off.</p>

<p>It is useful in cases of derangement of the digestive organs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>456. <em>Walnut Water.</em>&mdash;This is recommended as a remedy in
subduing nausea and vomiting, if administered in doses of a
wine-glassful every half-hour. It is distilled from green walnuts,
angelica-seeds, and brandy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>457. <em>Uses of Borax.</em>&mdash;Powdered borax, mixed with honey,
or conserve of roses, is an excellent remedy for inside sores of
the mouths of children.</p>

<p>If a little of the mixture be dissolved in warm water, it will
form, when cold, an efficacious gargle for an ulcerated sore
throat.</p>

<p>If a weak solution of borax in rose-water be constantly applied,
by means of a fine linen cloth, over the redness which
often affects the noses of delicate persons, it will relieve the
sense of heat, and remove the redness. Many other spots on
the face may be similarly removed.</p>

<p>It is likewise a very useful application to chilblains.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>458. <em>The virtues of Sage.</em>&mdash;This valuable herb was held in
such high esteem among the ancients, that they have left us a
Latin verse, which signifies&mdash;</p>

<p><em>"Why should a man die whilst he has sage in his garden?"</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>It is reckoned admirable as a cordial, and to sweeten and
cleanse the blood. It is good in nervous cases, and is given in
fevers, with a view to promote perspiration. With the addition
of a little lemon-juice, it is very grateful and cooling.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>459. <em>Sage Tea.</em>&mdash;Wood sage, which grows naturally, is the
finest kind; with a little alum it makes an excellent gargle for
a sore throat. It may be made as tea, but is better if boiled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>460. <em>Senna Tea.</em>&mdash;Macerate for an hour, in a covered vessel,
one ounce and a half of senna, a drachm of ginger, sliced, and
a pint of boiling water; the dose is from one-half to a wine-glassful.
Or, mix two drachms of senna, with a little Bohea
tea, in a quarter of a pint of boiling water, and add, when poured
off clear, a little sugar and milk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>461. <em>Chamomile Tea.</em>&mdash;Take of chamomile flowers one ounce,
boiling water, one quart; simmer for ten minutes, and strain.</p>

<p>Chamomile tea is well known as an emetic, when taken in a
tepid state. In some parts of England, a strong infusion of
chamomile is frequently taken at bed-time, as hot as it can be
swallowed, when it produces perspiration, and next morning
acts as a purgative. It is also there considered as one of the
best remedies for indigestion, colic, pains and obstructions of
the bowels, especially when arising from cold. A cup of coffee
taken hot on an empty stomach, will frequently be as efficacious
as the chamomile, in either of the above cases.</p>

<p>A small cupful of the tea, cold, taken in the morning, fasting,
is often serviceable for indigestion. Chamomiles are also employed
in fomentations, their greatest use being to retain the
heat of the application.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>462. <em>Linseed Tea.</em>&mdash;Pour two quarts of boiling water upon
one ounce of linseed, and two drachms of liquorice-root, sliced;
let it stand six hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>463. <em>Mint Tea.</em>&mdash;Mint, to be used as tea, should be cut
when just beginning to flower, and should be dried in the shade.
The young leaves are eaten in salads, and some eat them as the
leaves of sage, with bread and butter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>464. <em>Nitre</em> is a cheap and valuable medicine, both cooling
and purifying to the blood. In the feverishness that attends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a cold, from seven to ten grains of purified nitre, in a glass of
water, may be taken two or three times a day, with safety and
advantage. For old wounds, such as are commonly called
"a bad leg," great benefit will be derived from taking a solution
of nitre, prepared thus:&mdash;In one pint of boiling water, dissolve
two ounces of saltpetre; of which take a table-spoonful
twice a day. If it should occasion pain, a little hot ginger-tea
will soon give relief.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>465. <em>To make Verjuice.</em>&mdash;The acid of the juice of the crab or
wilding is called by the country people, verjuice, and is much
used in recent sprains, and in other cases, as an astringent or
repellant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>466. <em>Medicines in Travelling.</em>&mdash;In case of change of food disagreeing
with the stomach, dissolve a tea-spoonful of Epsom
salts in half a pint of water, as warm as it can be drunk, and
repeat the dose every half-hour, until it operates.</p>

<p>For diarrhœa, or acidity of stomach, mix one drachm of
compound powder of kino, with half an ounce of compound
powder of chalk; divide into six powders, and take one or two
a day, in three table-spoonfuls of water, and a tea-spoonful of
brandy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>467. <em>To prevent Sea-sickness.</em>&mdash;Pass a broad belt round the
body, and place within it, on the region of the stomach, a
pad stuffed with wool or horse-hair; this, when tightly braced,
restrains the involuntary motion of the stomach, occasioned by
the lurching of the vessel. During sickness, very weak cold
brandy and water will be found the best means of allaying the
heat and irritation.</p>

<p>The frequent use of any sea-sickness preventive is, however,
attended with danger.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>468. <em>Valuable properties of Cherry-tree Gum.</em>&mdash;The gum that
exudes from the trunk and branches of the cherry-tree is equal
to gum-Arabic. Hasselquist relates that, during a siege, more
than an hundred men were kept alive for two months nearly,
without any other sustenance than a little of this gum taken
into the mouth sometimes, and suffered gradually to dissolve.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>469. <em>How to get Sleep.</em>&mdash;How to get sleep is to many persons
a matter of high importance. Nervous persons who are troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with wakefulness and excitability, usually have a strong
tendency of blood on the brain, with cold extremities. The
pressure of the blood on the brain keeps it in a stimulated or
wakeful state, and the pulsations in the head are often painful.
Let such rise and chafe the body and extremities with a brush
or towel, or rub smartly with the hands to promote circulation
and withdraw the excessive amount of blood from the brain,
and you will sleep in a few moments. A cold bath, or a
sponge bath and rubbing, or a good run, or a rapid walk in the
open air, or going up or down stairs a few times, just before
retiring, will aid in equalizing circulation, and promoting sleep.
These rules are simple and easy of application in castle or
cabin, and minister to the comfort of thousands who would
freely expend money for an anodyne to promote "Nature's
sweet restorer, balmy sleep."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>470. <em>Remedy for Bad Breath.</em>&mdash;Take from five to ten drops
of muriatic acid, in an ale-glassful of barley-water, and add a
little lemon-juice and lemon-peel to flavor; mix for a draught
to be taken three times a day, for a month or six weeks at
least, and, if effectual, it may be continued occasionally.
Another medicine of this kind, which has often proved beneficial
when the stomach has been wrong, and the bowels costive,
is the following: Take one drachm of sulphate of magnesia,
two drachms of tincture of calumba, one ounce and a half of
infusion of roses; make a draught, to be taken every morning,
or every other morning, an hour before breakfast, for at least a
month.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>471. <em>Corpulence.</em>&mdash;Those who are afflicted with corpulence
should not allow themselves above six hours' sleep in the
twenty-four. They should take as much exercise as possible,
and avoid cream, malt liquors and soups&mdash;at least until they
have succeeded in reducing their bulk. Salt provisions are
good, having a tendency to promote perspiration, and carry off
fat. Soda water is also beneficial. <em>Recipe</em>: Take Castile soap,
in the form of pills, or electuary, of from one to four drachms
dissolved in a quarter of a pint of soft water, when going to
bed. But let not our lovely girls abuse their constitutions by
drinking vinegar for this purpose, for consumption has often
been produced by that habit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>472. <em>Leanness.</em>&mdash;This is not a disease; on the contrary, lean
people are generally healthy, muscular, strong, and active, and
remarkable for a keen appetite. But when there appears a
diminution of strength&mdash;when the spirits sink, and the food does
not freely digest&mdash;then leanness is the sign of lurking disease.
Such patients should take a cup of milk warm from the cow
every morning, or cold milk, with two raw fresh eggs beaten
up with it. A pint of the best porter or stout at dinner, and
the same at supper. Tea is better than coffee, and salad with
strong supplies of oil, not much vinegar, are recommended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>473. <em>Cure for Stammering.</em>&mdash;Impediments in the speech may
be cured, where there is no malformation of the organs of articulation,
by perseverance for three or four months in the
simple remedy of reading aloud, with the teeth closed, for at
least two hours in the course of each day.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>POISONS AND ANTIDOTES.</h4>

<p>474. <em>Acids.</em>&mdash;These cause great heat, and sensation of burning
pain, from the mouth down to the stomach. Remedies,
magnesia, soda, pearlash, or soap, dissolved in water; then use
stomach-pump or emetics.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>475. <em>Alcohol.</em>&mdash;First cleanse out the stomach by an emetic,
then dash cold water on the head, and give ammonia (spirits
of hartshorn.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>476. <em>Alkalies.</em>&mdash;Best remedy is vinegar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>477. <em>Ammonia.</em>&mdash;Remedy, lemon-juice or vinegar, afterwards
milk and water or flaxseed tea.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>478. <em>Arsenic.</em>&mdash;Remedies, in the first place evacuate the
stomach, then give the white of eggs, lime-water, or chalk and
water, charcoal and the preparations of iron, particularly
hydrate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>479. <em>Belladonna, or Night Henbane.</em>&mdash;Give emetics, and then
plenty of vinegar and water or lemonade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>480. <em>Charcoal.</em>&mdash;In poisons by carbonic gas, remove the patient
to open air, dash cold water on the head and body, and
stimulate nostrils and lungs by hartshorn, at the same time
rubbing the chest briskly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>481. <em>Corrosive Sublimate.</em>&mdash;Give white of eggs freshly
mixed with water, or give wheat flour and water, or soap and
water freely.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>482. <em>Creosote.</em>&mdash;White of eggs and the emetics.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>483. <em>Laudanum.</em>&mdash;Same as opium.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>484. <em>Lead. White Lead and Sugar of Lead.</em>&mdash;Remedies,
alum, cathartic, such as castor oil and Epsom salts, especially.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>485. <em>Mushrooms, when poisonous.</em>&mdash;Give emetics, and then
plenty of vinegar and water, with dose of ether, if handy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>486. <em>Nitrate of Silver</em>, (<em>lunar caustic</em>).&mdash;Give a strong solution
of common salt, and then emetics.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>487. <em>Nitrate of Potash, or Saltpetre.</em>&mdash;Give emetics, then
copious draughts of flaxseed tea, milk and water, and other
soothing drinks.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>488. <em>Opium.</em>&mdash;First give a strong emetic of mustard and
water, then strong coffee and acid drinks, dash cold water on
the head.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>489. <em>Oxalic Acid.</em>&mdash;Frequently mistaken for Epsom Salts.
Remedies, chalk, magnesia, or soap and water freely, then
emetics.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>490. <em>Prussic Acid.</em>&mdash;When there is time, administer chlorine,
in the shape of soda or lime. Hot brandy and water.
Hartshorn and turpentine also useful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>491. <em>Snake Bites, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Apply immediately strong hartshorn,
and take it internally; also, give sweet oil, and stimulants
freely. Apply a ligature tight above the part bitten, and then
apply a cupping-glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>492. <em>Tartar Emetic.</em>&mdash;Give large doses of tea made of galls,
Peruvian bark, or white oak bark.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>493. <em>Tobacco.</em>&mdash;First an emetic, then astringent tea, then
stimulants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>494. <em>Verdigris.</em>&mdash;Plenty of white of egg and water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>495. <em>White Vitriol.</em>&mdash;Give the patient plenty of milk and
water.</p>

<p>In almost all cases of poisoning, emetics are highly useful,
and of those, one of the very best, because most prompt and
ready, is the common mustard flour or powder, a spoonful of
which, stirred up in warm water, may be given every five or
ten minutes, until free vomiting can be obtained.</p>

<p>Emetics and warm demulcent drinks, such as milk and
water, flaxseed or slippery elm tea, chalk water, &amp;c., should be
administered without delay. The subsequent management of
the case will of course be left to a physician.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>496. <em>To prevent Death from the Bite of <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'Venemous'">Venomous</span> Animals.</em>&mdash;From
observations made by Dr. Bancroft, it is found, that in
South America, where the most venomous serpents abound,
a very tight ligature, instantly made after the bite, between the
part bitten and the trunk of the body, will prevent immediate
danger, and allow time for proper means of remedy, either by
excision of the whole joint, just above the ligature, or by topical
applications upon the part bitten.</p>

<p>For instance, if the bite should be upon the end of the finger,
a tight ligature of small cord should immediately be made beyond
the next joint of the finger.</p>

<p>If the bite is on any part of the hand, the ligature should
be made above the wrist, by means of a garter or cord, lapped
several times round the arm, and rendered as tight as possible,
by a small stick thrust betwixt the folds of the cord or garter,
and twisted round very hard, to prevent the circulation of the
blood betwixt the part bitten and the other part of the body.
Ligatures of the same kind, applied by any one present, or the
man himself, will frequently save a person's life, where, by
accident, an artery in any of the limbs is wounded, and no surgeon
is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>497. <em>Prevention of Hydrophobia.</em>&mdash;As there has been hitherto
no remedy discovered which can be said to possess a specific
control over this dreadful malady, and therefore little hope can
be entertained of a cure for it, our best endeavors should be
directed to the <em>preventive</em> treatment. This is to be commenced,
then, by completely cutting out the whole wound as soon as
possible after the bite of a suspected animal. After this, bleeding
should be encouraged by immersion in warm water, or the
application of a cupping-glass. Caustic should next be applied
to every part of the wound, which is then to be covered with
a poultice, and suffered to heal by granulation, or be kept open,
and made to suppurate, by irritating ointments. The excision
should never be omitted, even though the bitten part have
healed, and let the interval since its occurrence be what it may.
As for any of innumerable so-called specifics, there is not one
that is worth a moment's trial.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>498. <em>To alleviate the Pain occasioned by the Sting of Gnats.</em>&mdash;The
disagreeable itching occasioned by the sting of these insects,
may be removed by volatile alkali, or immediately rubbing
and washing the part affected with cold water.</p>

<p>At night, to rub with fuller's earth and water, lessens the
inflammation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>499. <em>Simple and effectual cure for those who may accidentally
have swallowed a Wasp.</em>&mdash;Instantly, on the alarming accident
taking place, put a tea-spoonful of common salt in your mouth,
which will instantaneously not only kill the wasp, but at the
same time heal the sting.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>500. <em>For the Sting of a Wasp or Bee.</em>&mdash;Spread over the part
a plaster of salad oil and common salt; if oil be not at hand,
the salt may be used, moistened with water or vinegar. Or,
keep the part constantly moist with a rag dipped in sal-volatile
and cold water, as strong as can be borne without raising the
skin. Or, immediately after taking out the sting, get an onion
and bruise it, and apply it to the stung place, and it will afford
immediate relief. Or, a washerwoman's blue-bag, applied in
the same manner, will have a like effect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>501. <em>Sting of a Nettle.</em>&mdash;Rub the part affected with balm,
rosemary, mint, or any other aromatic herb, and the smart
will soon cease.</p>

<h4>BATHS AND BATHING.</h4>

<p>502. The best materials for constructing baths, are slabs of
polished marble, bedded with water-tight cement, in a wooden
case, and carefully united at the edges. But, as white or veined
marble baths are apt to get yellow or discolored by frequent
use, and cannot easily be cleaned, large Dutch tiles, or square
pieces of white earthenware, are sometimes substituted; these,
however, are with difficulty kept water-tight, so that marble is
altogether preferable. Copper, or tinned iron plates, are also
used; the former is more expensive at the outset, but far more
durable than the latter, which is also liable to leakage at the
joints, unless excellently made. Both copper and iron should
be well covered, in and outside, with several coats of paint.
Wooden tubs&mdash;square, oblong, or oval&mdash;are sometimes used
for warm baths, and are cheap and convenient; but the wood
contracts a mouldy smell, and there is great difficulty in preventing
shrinkage in them, and keeping them water-tight.</p>

<p>The fittest place for baths, is the bed-room floor; they are
sometimes placed in the basement story, which is cold and
damp, and in all weather disagreeable.</p>

<p>Due attention should be paid to the warming and ventilation
of the bath-room. A temperature of 70 degrees, by the thermometer,
should be kept up in it; and ventilation is requisite,
to prevent the moisture settling upon the walls and furniture.</p>

<p>An improvement in the construction of baths, is a slightly
hollowed space at one end, to receive the head of the bather,
so as to prevent that sensation of cramp which is often experienced
from the ordinary, abrupt shape of a bath.</p>

<p>The hand is a very uncertain test for the heat of water, and
should, therefore, not be relied on in preparing a bath; but a
thermometer should be employed, which will denote the actual
temperature, thus:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>503. <em>Hand Shower-Bath.</em>&mdash;An excellent hand shower-bath
for children, has been invented. It consists of a metal vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
containing about a gallon, the bottom of which is pierced with
holes, while the upper part is open, and provided with a handle.
When intended to be used, the vessel is immersed in a pail of
water, and it quickly fills from the lower part. The thumb is
placed over the aperture at the apex, which prevents all escape
of water. It may be held at a convenient distance over the
child, and the moment the thumb is removed, there falls a refreshing
shower, which may be stopped instantaneously, by
placing the thumb over the upper opening.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>504. <em>Simple Vapor Bath.</em>&mdash;Wrap the patient in blankets,
which fasten closely about the neck, leaving the head exposed:
then place him in a chair, under which set a basin or deep dish,
with half a pint of spirits of wine, or whisky, which should be
ignited: close the blankets to the floor, and in a few minutes
the patient will be in a profuse perspiration, and should be put
to bed between warm blankets.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>505. <em>Advantages of Bathing.</em>&mdash;It is a fact officially recorded,
that during the terrible visitations of cholera in France, out of
nearly 16,228 subscribers to the public baths of Paris, Bordeaux,
and Marseilles, only two deaths among them were
ascribed to cholera. We doubt whether there exists a more
effectual preventive of disease of every kind, and a greater promoter
of good health at all times, than the practice of daily
bathing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>506. <em>Uses of Hot Water.</em>&mdash;The efficacy of hot water, on many
occasions in life, cannot be too generally known. It is an excellent
gargle for a bad sore throat, or quinsy. In bruises, hot
water, by immersion and fomentation, will remove pain, and
prevent discoloration and stiffness. It has the same effect after
a blow. It should be applied as quickly as possible, and as hot
as it can be borne. Insertion in hot water will also cure that
troublesome and very painful ailment, the whitlow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>507. <em>Good effects of Bathing.</em>&mdash;"I am often asked, what baths
are safest&mdash;as if everything, by its fitness or unfitness, is not
safe, or the reverse. The value of all baths depends upon their
fitness; and that, in many instances, can only be known by
trial. It depends upon constitution, more than upon the name
of a disease, whether particular patients shall be benefited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
one bath or another. Generally speaking, when the skin is hot
and dry, a cold bath will do good; and when chilly, a hot bath.
But the reverse sometimes happens. The cold stage of ague,
may at once be cut short by a cold bath. I have seen a shivering
hypochondriac dash into the cold plunge bath, and come
out, in a minute or two, perfectly cured of all his aches and
whimseys. But, in cases of this nature, everything depends
upon the <em>glow</em> or <em>reaction</em> which the bath produces; and that
has as much to do with surprise or shock as with the temperature
of the bath. I have seen a person with a hot, dry skin,
go into a warm bath, and come out just as refreshed as if he
had taken a cold one. In that case, the perspiration which it
excited, must have been the principal means of relief.</p>

<p>"So far as my own experience goes, I prefer the cold and
tepid shower-baths, and the cold plunge-bath, to any other; but
there are cases in which these disagree, and I, therefore, occasionally
order the warm or vapor-bath instead."&mdash;<em>Dr. Dickson.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>508. <em>Diet for Patients.</em>&mdash;"I am every day asked by my patients,
what diet they should take. I generally answer by the
question, 'How old are you?' Suppose they say, <em>Forty</em>&mdash;'Forty!'
I rejoin: 'you who have had forty years' experience
of what agrees and disagrees with you&mdash;how can you ask me
who have no experience of the kind in your case whatever?'
Surely, gentlemen, a patient's experience of what agrees and
disagrees with his own particular constitution, is far better than
any theory of yours or mine. Why, bless my life! in many
chronic diseases, the diet which a man can take to-day, would
be rejected with disgust to-morrow; under such circumstances,
would you still, according to common medical practice, tell a
sick person to go on taking what he himself found worried him
to death? Gentlemen, I hope better things of you.</p>

<p>"The only general caution you need give your patients on
the subject of diet, is <em>moderation</em>; moderation in using the
things which they find agree with themselves best. You may
direct them to take their food in small quantities at a time, at
short <em>periodic</em> intervals&mdash;intervals of two or three hours, for
example; and tell them to take the trouble to masticate it
properly before they swallow it, so as not to give a weak
stomach the <em>double</em> work of mastication and digestion&mdash;these
processes being, even in health, essentially distinct. Unless
properly comminuted and mixed with the saliva, how can you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
expect the food to be anything but a source of inconvenience
to persons whom the smallest trifle will frequently discompose?"&mdash;<em>Dr.
Dickson's Lectures.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>509. <em>Abstinence, or Starvation.</em>&mdash;Beware of carrying this too
far!&mdash;for "abstinence engenders maladies." So Shakspeare
said, and so nature will tell you, in the teeth of all the doctors
in Europe! Abstinence may produce almost every form of
disease which has entered into the consideration of the physician.&mdash;<em>Ibid.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>510. <em>The Blood is the Life&mdash;never be Bled!</em>&mdash;"He who loses
a pint of blood, loses a pint of his life. Of what is the body
composed? Is it not of blood, and blood only? What fills
up the excavation of an ulcer or an abscess? What re-produces
the bone of the leg or thigh, after it has been thrown off dead,
in nearly all its length? what but the living <span class="smcap">BLOOD</span>, under the
vito-electrical influence of the brain and nerves! How does
the slaughtered animal die? Of loss of blood solely. Is not
the blood, then, in the impressive language of Scripture, 'the
life of the flesh?' How remarkable, that while the value of
the blood to the animal economy should be thus so distinctly
and emphatically acknowledged, blood-letting is not even once
alluded to, among the various modes of <em>cure</em> mentioned in the
sacred volume. We have 'balms,' 'balsams,' 'baths,' 'charms,'
'physics,'&mdash;'poultices,' even&mdash;but loss of blood, never! Had
it been practised by the Jews, why this omission? Will the
men who now so lavishly pour out the blood, dispute its importance
in the animal economy? Will they deny that it forms
the basis of the solids? that when the body has been wasted
by long disease, it is by the blood only it can recover its healthy
volume and appearance?"&mdash;<em>Dr. Dickson's Lectures.</em></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>THE TOILET.</h4>

<p>511. Personal beauty is the gift of nature, but its preservation
depends much on the care of its possessor. Beauty may
also be cultivated and enhanced; even plainness may be improved,
and the defects that sickness, accidents, and age impress
on the human features and form, may be greatly remedied by
simple means, and attention to a few important rules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The first requisite for the preservation and improvement of
personal beauty is <em>good temper</em>. The teachings of the New
Testament, if you follow its precepts, will insure you this
grace. The second requirement is <em>good health</em>. The most important
rules for its preservation and recovery are given in this
chapter. The third requisite comprises attention to neatness,
and that general care of the person which the rules and receipts
we here subjoin, will aid in making complete.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>512. <em>Of the Hair.</em>&mdash;It is a great mistake to plait the hair of
children under eleven or twelve years of age. The process of
plaiting more or less strains the hairs in their roots by pulling
them tight; tends to deprive them of their requisite supply of
nutriment; and checks their growth. The hair of girls should
be cut rather short, and allowed to curl freely. When they
are about eleven or twelve, the hair should be twisted into a
coil, not too tight, nor tied at the end with thin thread, but with
a piece of riband.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>513. <em>Do not Shave the Head.</em>&mdash;Shaving the head is always
injurious to the hair, the bulbs being frequently destroyed by
the process; and washing frequently with an alkaline preparation,
such as soap and water, is decidedly objectionable, for
that, as well as sea-water, is very apt to change the color of the
hair.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>514. <em>To purify and beautify the Hair.</em>&mdash;An excellent means
of keeping the hair sweet, clean, glossy, and curly, is to brush
it with a rather hard brush dipped by the surface only in eau
de Portugal ("Portugal water"). In order to have it fresh and
of fine quality, take a pint of orange flower water, a pint of rose
water, and half a pint of myrtle water. To these put a quarter
of an ounce of distilled spirit of musk, and an ounce of spirit
of ambergris. Shake the whole well together, and the water
will be ready for use. Only a small quantity should be made
at a time, as it does not keep long, except in moderate weather,
being apt to spoil either with cold or heat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>515. <em>To promote the Growth of Hair.</em>&mdash;Mix equal parts of
olive oil and spirits of rosemary, and add a few drops of oil of
nutmeg. If the hair be rubbed every night with a little of this
liniment, and the proportion be very gradually augmented, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
will answer every purpose of increasing the growth of hair,
much more effectually than can be attained by any of the boasting
empirical preparations which are imposed on the credulous
purchaser.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>516. <em>Curling Liquid for the Hair.</em>&mdash;When the hair will not
curl naturally, the curling irons should not be used; they only
extract the moisture, and render the hair crisp and harsh. An
excellent curling liquid is the following:&mdash;Put two pounds of
common soap, cut small, into three pints of spirits of wine,
with eight ounces of potash, and melt the whole, stirring it with
a clean piece of wood. Add some essence of amber, vanilla,
and nevoli, about a quarter of an ounce of each, to render the
fluid agreeable. The liquids which are sold for the professed
purpose of assisting in curling the hair, are chiefly composed
of either oily or extractive substances.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>517. <em>To prevent Hair from falling out.</em>&mdash;Make a strong
decoction of white-oak bark in water, and use it freely. It is
best to make but little at a time, and have it fresh at least
once a fortnight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>518. <em>To avoid Grey Hairs.</em>&mdash;Those who would avoid that
prominent mark of approaching old age, called grey hair,
must be careful in the treatment of the hair in their youth.
They must avoid constricting the skin, and strangling the hair
at its roots, and everything that may throw into the blood an
undue portion of lime. We say an <em>undue</em> portion, because a
certain quantity of lime is indispensable in our system for repairing
the wear and tear of the bones, teeth, &amp;c. The lime
necessary for the repair of bone is manufactured by the stomach
and liver, along with the blood, from various articles of
our diet which contain it. The greatest supply is usually from
the water which we drink, or which is employed in the various
processes of cooking and preparing liquors. All animal food
also contains some portion of lime, as well as some of the sorts
of vegetable food. Ascertain, then, by chemical trial, whether
the water used for your tea, coffee, soups, &amp;c., contains a large
proportion of lime; and, if it do, you must either have it chemically
purified, or remove to some other place where the water
is more free from lime. If water be hard, you may be certain
that it contains too much lime to be safely used. Rain-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
is the safest for tea and other liquids. Bread will always contain
a portion of lime; you must, therefore, be careful in dealing
with respectable bakers, who will not increase that unavoidable
quantity by means of adulterating matter (such as
whiting) which contains lime.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>519. <em>To soften and cleanse the Hair.</em>&mdash;Beat up an egg, rub it
well into the hair, and then wash the head well. If the hair is
very oily, add the juice of half a lemon. This receipt also answers
much better for washing pet dogs than soap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>520. <em>To make a Curling Fluid for the Hair.</em>&mdash;Melt a piece
of white bees'-wax, about the size of a filbert kernel or large
pea, in one ounce of olive oil; to this add one or two drops of
<span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'ottar'">attar</span> of roses or any other perfume.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>521. <em>Gen. Twiggs' Hair Dye.</em>&mdash;Dissolve in a pint of rose-water,
one ounce of lac sulphur, and half an ounce of sugar of
lead. Wet the hair with this mixture thoroughly every night,
shaking the bottle occasionally. Some persons prefer whisky
to rose-water, in mixing the articles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>522. <em>To change Hair to a deep Brown.</em>&mdash;A solution of silver
caustic in water is the foundation of all the nostrums for this
purpose. It must be well diluted before used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>523. <em>To dye the Hair Black.</em>&mdash;Procure from the dyer's a
quantity of walnut-water; and with this wash the hair, as the
first part of the process. Then make an aromatic tincture of
galls, by scenting the common tincture with any agreeable perfume;
and with this wet the hair, which must next be moistened
with a strong solution of sulphate of iron.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>524. <em>A simple Hair-dye.</em>&mdash;Boil in a pint of water a handful of
rosemary; when cold, strain and bottle, but do not cork it.
Renew it every few weeks. Wet the hair with it every night.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>525. <em>To darken the Eye-brows.</em>&mdash;Take an ounce of walnuts, an
ounce of frankincense, an ounce of resin, and an ounce of mastick.
Burn them all on clear, red-hot charcoal, and receive the
fumes into a funnel, in which a very fine black powder, slightly
perfumed and unctuous, will adhere. Mix this with a little oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of myrtle, in a leaden mortar, and apply it to the eye-brows.
This paste has the property of resisting both heat and perspiration;
but it must be occasionally renewed. The following
method may also be used: Burn a clove in the flame of a wax-candle,
dip it into the juice of elder-berries, and apply it to the
eye-brows. The powder, also, which is used in the East for
painting the eye-lashes, and which is composed of antimony and
bismuth, may be safely and advantageously used. Or, a paste
prepared from powdered black lead, with eau de Cologne, or
oil of myrtle, or essence of bergamot, will suffice for the purpose.
When the eye-brows become long and shaggy, they give
a ferocious and repulsive expression to the countenance. The
scissors should in that case be often used. Some of the longest
hairs might also be removed with the tweezers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>526. <em>To know whether Hair Powder is adulterated with Lime.</em>&mdash;Put
a little crude sal-ammoniac, in powder, to the suspected
hair powder, and add a little warm water to the mixture, and
stir it about; if the powder has been adulterated with lime, a
strong smell of volatile alkali will arise from this mixture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>527. <em>To perfume Hair Powder.</em>&mdash;Take one drachm of musk,
four <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'ouuces'">ounces</span> of lavender blossoms, one and a half drachm of
civet, and half a drachm of ambergris; pound the whole together,
and pass it through a sieve. Preserve this mixture in
well-stopped bottles, and add more or less thereof, as agreeable,
in your hair powder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>528. <em>To improve the Hair.</em>&mdash;Powdered hartshorn, mixed
with oil, being rubbed upon the head of persons who have lost
their hair, will cause it to grow again. A very good oil for the
hair is made by mixing one part of the liquid hartshorn with
nine parts of pure castor-oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>529. <em>An economical Hair Wash.</em>&mdash;Dissolve in one quart of
boiling water one ounce of borax and half an ounce of camphor;
these ingredients fine. When cool, the solution will be ready
for use. Damp the hair with it frequently. This wash not
only cleanses and beautifies, but strengthens the hair, preserves
the color, and prevents baldness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>530. <em>To remove Superfluous Hair.</em>&mdash;This is very difficult, for
if you pull the hair out by the roots from those places which it
disfigures, there are thousands of roots ready to start through
the skin the moment you make room for them. Old authors
recommend depilatories in great variety. The principal of
these methods consist in rubbing upon the part from which the
hair is to be removed, leaven, parsley water, juice of acacia, the
gum of ivy or of the cherry-tree, dissolved in spirits of wine,
&amp;c. Madame Elisi Voiart, in her "Encyclopédie des Dames,"
recommends a few drops of dulcified spirit of salt, (that is, muriatic
acid distilled with rectified spirits of wine,) to be applied
with a camel hair pencil.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>OF THE COMPLEXION.</h4>

<p>531. <em>Never Paint.</em>&mdash;The use of white paint as a cosmetic affects
the eyes, which it renders painful and watery. It changes the
texture of the skin, on which it produces pimples; attacks the
teeth, destroys the enamel, and loosens them. It heats the
mouth and throat, infecting and corrupting the saliva. Lastly,
it penetrates the pores of the skin, acting by degrees on the
spongy substance of the lungs, and inducing disease. Powdered
magnesia, or violet powder, is no further injurious than by
stopping the pores of the skin; but this is quite injury enough
to preclude its use. The best cosmetics are early hours, exercise,
and temperance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>532. <em>To soften the Skin and improve the Complexion.</em>&mdash;Mix
in a cup of milk a little flowers of sulphur; let it stand for an
hour or two; then, without disturbing the sulphur, rub the milk
into the skin. It will keep it soft and clear. It should be used
before washing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>533. <em>How to treat Freckles.</em>&mdash;Most of us have observed the
effect produced on white paper by holding it closely to the fire:
it changes rapidly from white to brown, and becomes scorched.
Chemists tell us that most combustible things, both in the animal
and vegetable world, have carbon for their basis&mdash;<em>so has
the skin</em>; and, if it be exposed to the heat, it becomes, like
them, spotted or charred. The iron and oxygen in the blood
also assist to produce this effect. Thus we have the cause of
freckles. Those who, like Richard Cœur de Lion, and Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Queen of Scots, have red hair (which is caused by a red-colored
oil, more strongly impregnated with iron than others), are most
liable to freckles.</p>

<p>The most effectual means of removing freckles, is the use of
those chemicals which will dissolve the existing combination.
The freckles are situated in the second or middle membrane of
the skin; and, before any other application, it will be advisable
to soften the surface by the use of some mild balsam
or paste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>534. <em>For Freckles.</em>&mdash;One ounce of bitter almonds, one ditto
of barley flour, mix with a sufficient quantity of honey to make
the whole into a smooth paste; with which the face, more particularly
where the freckles are visible, is to be anointed at
night, and the paste washed off in the morning. After a few
days the skin will be prepared for a chemical remedy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>535. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;To decompose the freckles, by laying hold
of the iron, the following mixture may be applied: Take one
drachm of muriatic acid, half a pint of rain-water, half a tea-spoonful
of spirit of lavender; mix well together, and apply
two or three times a day to the freckles, with a camel's hair
brush. The acid seizes upon the iron, and the oxygen is disengaged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>536. <em>Purifying water for Freckled Skin.</em>&mdash;Take one tea-spoonful
of liquor of potassa, two ounces and a half of pure
water, and ten drops of eau de Cologne. Mix, and apply three
times a day with a camel's hair brush.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>537. <em>Cosmetic Lotion for Freckles.</em>&mdash;Take a tea-cupful of cold
sour milk, scrape into it a quantity of horse-radish. Let this
stand from six to twelve hours; and then, being well strained,
let it be applied, as before directed, two or three times a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>538. <em>Preventive Wash for Sunburn.</em>&mdash;Take two drachms of
borax, one drachm of Roman alum, one drachm of camphor,
half an ounce of sugar-candy, and one pound of ox-gall; mix
and stir well together, and repeat the stirring three or four
times a day, until the mixture becomes transparent; then strain
it through filtering paper, and it is fit for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>539. <em>Grape Lotion for Sunburn.</em>&mdash;Dip a bunch of green
grapes in a basin of water; sprinkle it with powdered alum
and salt, mixed together; wrap it in paper, and bake it
under hot ashes; then express the remaining juice, and wash
the face with the liquid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>540. <em>Lemon Cream for Sunburn and Freckles.</em>&mdash;Put two
spoonfuls of fresh cream into half a pint of new milk; squeeze
into it the juice of a lemon, and half a glass of brandy, a little
alum, and loaf sugar; boil the whole, skim it well, and, when
cool, it will be fit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>541. <em>A French Receipt.</em>&mdash;Take equal parts of the seeds of
the melon, pompion, gourd, and cucumber, pounded and reduced
to powder or meal; add to it fresh cream sufficient to
dilute the flour; beat all up together, adding a sufficient quantity
of milk, as it may be required, to make an ointment, and
then apply it to the face. Leave it there for half an hour, and
then wash it off with warm soft water. Pimpernel water is
often used on the continent for the purpose of whitening the
complexion. It is there in so high reputation, that it is said
generally that it ought to be continually on the toilet of every
lady who cares for the brightness of her skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>542. <em>Moles.</em>&mdash;The author of "The Art of Beauty," whose
work appeared in 1824, has very judiciously observed: "The
common brown mole appears to be much of the same nature as
freckles, and to be situated in the middle layer of the skin, or
membrane of color. Moles are sometimes so placed as to improve
rather than injure a fine face. They contrast with the
delicacy of a fair skin, and give a pleasing archness of expression
to the countenance. They are, however, most frequently
found on women of a dark complexion. The coloring matter,
as in the case of freckles and sunburn, is probably some chemical
combination of iron. Moles have evidently a superabundant
vitality, and a tendency to increased action, in consequence,
perhaps, of the stimulus of the iron; and hence they
are often slightly elevated above the surface, and the natural
down of the skin is changed into a tuft of hair. The same cosmetic
applications may be tried as for freckles, with gentle friction,
but they are seldom successful. But it will be found very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
dangerous to apply depilatories to eradicate the tufts of hair on
moles, as cancer in the face is not unfrequently the consequence
of such applications."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>543. <em>Birth Marks.</em>&mdash;Let them alone, or apply to some eminent
surgeon to attempt their removal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>544. <em>Worm Pimple, with black points.</em>&mdash;They are very common,
and very unsightly, giving the skin an oily, greasy, and
dirty appearance. Their origin is to be traced to the obstruction
of the fountains or glands placed immediately under the
skin, from which a minute pipe carries off the perspiration.
This moisture, not getting free egress, thickens and closes the
pores: it then catches the dust and other impurities, floating
in the atmosphere, and soon becomes black. If squeezed violently
between the nails, this thickened matter will be driven
out, in the form of a yellowish white worm, with a black head,
which is nothing more than the extraneous matter just mentioned.
That there is any vitality in it, is an absurd, but popular
and prevalent error. These pimples generally cluster on
the sides of the nose and on the forehead, whilst the skin around
them is greasy. They should be thoroughly pressed out of
every pore, or there they will remain, and no cosmetic will dislodge
them. When this is effectually done, the following safe
and simple application may be tried: take one ounce of bitter
almonds and one ounce of barley-flour; mix them with honey,
until they form a smooth paste, and anoint the skin at night.
Gentle friction, either with the hand or with a soft glove, is also
good. When this state of the skin is induced by bilious disorders,
indigestion, &amp;c., sulphur, purgatives, and other remedies
must be taken to remove it; but not without medical advice,
as they often are the reverse of effectual.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>545. <em>Another simple Remedy.</em>&mdash;Bathe the pimples several
times a day with lukewarm water and a sponge, rubbing the
sponge over a piece of yellow soap. There is a truly healing
power in soap, which is surprising when we learn to appreciate
it, and which is quite distinct from mere cleanliness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>546. <em>Wash for Pimples.</em>&mdash;Dissolve half a drachm of salt of
tartar in three ounces of spirit of wine; apply with linen or a
camel-hair pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>547. <em>A Paste for the Skin.</em>&mdash;Boil the whites of four eggs in
rose-water; add to it a small quantity of alum; beat the whole
to the consistence of a paste. This will give great firmness to
the skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>548. <em>Cold Cream.</em>&mdash;Take two ounces of oil of sweet almonds,
and one drachm each of white wax and spermaceti, or half an
ounce of white wax alone, which scrape very fine, and put them
with the oil into an earthen dish, to melt slowly on the embers,
and stir it till it becomes quite smooth. When it is cooling,
add one ounce of rose-water, and put it into a gallipot, closely
covered. It should be a very thick cream.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>549. <em>Fard.</em>&mdash;This paste is useful in removing sun-burnings,
effects of wind on the face, and accidental cutaneous eruptions.
It must be applied on going to bed. First, wash the face,
and, when dry, rub the fard over it, and let it remain all night.
Take two ounces of oil of sweet almonds, and the same quantity
of spermaceti; melt them over a slow fire. When they are
dissolved and mixed, take it from the fire, and stir into it one
table-spoonful of fine honey. Continue stirring it till it is cold,
and it is then fit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>550. <em>Court-plaster, or black Sticking-plaster.</em>&mdash;Take half an
ounce of benzoin, and six ounces of rectified spirit; dissolve
and strain; then take one ounce of isinglass, and half a pint of
hot water; dissolve and strain separately from the former.
Mix the two, and set them aside to cool, when a jelly will be
formed; and this is warmed and brushed ten or twelve times
over a piece of black silk, stretched smooth. When this is
done enough, and dry, finish it with a solution of four ounces
of chian turpentine in six ounces of tincture of benzoin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>551. <em>An excellent Tooth-powder.</em>&mdash;One of the best tooth-powders
is made by mixing together one ounce and a half of prepared
chalk, half an ounce of powder of bark, and a quarter of
an ounce of camphor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>552. <em>Charcoal Tooth-powder.</em>&mdash;Pound charcoal as fine as possible,
in a mortar, or grind it in a mill; then well sift it, and
apply a little of it to the teeth about twice a week, and it will
not only render them beautifully white, but will also make the
breath sweet, and the gums firm and comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>If the charcoal is ground in a mortar, it is convenient to grind
it in water, to prevent the dust from flying about. Indeed, the
powder is more convenient for use, when kept in water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>553. <em>A safe Tooth-powder.</em>&mdash;Cut a slice of thick bread into
squares, and burn it till it becomes charcoal. Pound it, and
sift it through a <em>fine</em> muslin. It is then ready for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>554. <em>Another Tooth-powder.</em>&mdash;Mix hartshorn shavings, calcined
and pulverized, three-fifths; myrrh, pulverized, two-fifths.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>555. <em>A good Dentifrice.</em>&mdash;Dissolve two ounces of borax in
three pints of boiling water; before it is quite cold, add one
tea-spoonful of tincture of myrrh, and one table-spoonful of
spirits of camphor. Bottle the mixture for use. Add one
wine-glassful of the solution to half a pint of tepid water, and
use it daily. It preserves and beautifies the teeth, arrests decay,
and induces a healthy action in the gums.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>556. <em>Camphor Tooth-powder.</em>&mdash;This excellent dentifrice is
made by mixing prepared chalk, finely pulverized, and sifted
through a fine muslin, with an equal quantity of pulverized
camphor, prepared in the same way. It is a good preservative
of the teeth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>557. <em>Orris-root Tooth-powder.</em>&mdash;Mix equal quantities of finely
pulverized and sifted orris-root and prepared chalk. Charcoal
may be used instead of chalk, in both these receipts, but it
must be prepared with great care, else its grittiness will injure
the enamel of the teeth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>558. <em>To whiten the Teeth.</em>&mdash;Mix honey with finely powdered
charcoal, and use the paste as a dentifrice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>559. <em>Wash for the Teeth.</em>&mdash;One ounce of myrrh, powdered,
and dissolved in one pint of spirits of wine. A little of this
dropped on the tooth-brush, is excellent for the teeth and gums.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>560. <em>To remove Tartar from the Teeth.</em>&mdash;1st. The use of the
tooth-brush night and morning, and at least rinsing the mouth
after every meal at which animal food is taken. 2d. Once
daily run the brush lightly two or three times over soap, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
dip it in salt, and with it clean the teeth, working the brush up
and down rather than&mdash;or as well as&mdash;backwards and forwards.
This is a cheap, safe, and effectual dentifrice. 3d. Eat freely
of common cress&mdash;the sort used with mustard, under the name
of small salad; it must be eaten with salt only. If thus used
two or three days in succession, it will effectually loosen tartar,
even of long standing. The same effect is produced, though
perhaps not in an equal degree, by eating strawberries and
raspberries, especially the former. A leaf of common green
sage rubbed on the teeth, is useful both in cleansing and polishing,
and probably many other common vegetable productions
also.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>561. <em>Obs.</em> Soap is not at all a desirable medium for cleaning
the teeth, as, though it may whiten for the time, the alkaline
process destroys the enamel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>562. <em>To fill a decayed Tooth.</em>&mdash;When a tooth is too much
decayed to be filled by a dentist, or the person is at a distance
from one, gutta percha will be found an useful expedient.
Drop a small piece of this substance in boiling water, then
taking off as much as will probably fill the tooth nearly level,
press it, while soft, into the cavity. Then hold cold water in
the mouth on that side, to harden it. It has been known to
preserve a tooth two years at least, and keeps it free from cold.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>FOR THE DRESSING-TABLE.</h4>

<p>563. <em>To make soft Pomatum.</em>&mdash;Beat half a pound of unsalted
fresh lard in common water; then soak and beat it in two rose-waters;
drain it, and beat it with two spoonfuls of brandy;
let it drain from this; add to it some essence of lemon, and
keep it in small pots.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>564. <em>Or</em>: Soak half a pound of clear beef marrow, and one
pound of unsalted fresh lard, in water, two or three days,
changing and beating it every day. Put it into a sieve, and,
when dry, into a jar, and the jar into a saucepan of water.
When melted, pour it into a basin, and beat it with two spoonfuls
of brandy; drain off the brandy, and then add essence of
lemon, bergamot, or any other scent that is liked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>565. <em>Hard Pomatum.</em>&mdash;Prepare equal quantities of beef
marrow and mutton suet, as before, using the brandy to preserve
it, and adding the scent; then pour it into moulds, or, if
you have none, into phials of the size you choose the rolls to
be. When cold, break the bottles, clear away the glass carefully,
and put paper round the rolls.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>566. <em>Or</em>: Take equal quantities of marrow, melted and
strained, lard, and castor oil; warm all together; add any scent
you please; stir until cold, and put into pots.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>567. <em>Pomade Divine.</em>&mdash;Clear one and a half pound of beef
marrow from the strings and bone; put it into an earthen pan
or vessel of water fresh from the spring, and change the water
night and morning for ten days; then steep it in rose-water
twenty-four hours, and drain it in a cloth till quite dry. Take
one ounce of each of the following articles, namely: storax,
gum-benjamin, and odoriferous cypress powder; half an ounce
of cinnamon, two drachms of cloves, and two drachms of nutmeg,
all finely powdered: mix them with the marrow above
prepared; then put all the ingredients into a pewter pot that
holds three pints; make a paste of white of egg and flour, and
lay it upon a piece of rag. Over that must be another piece
of linen, to cover the top of the pot very close, that none of the
steam may evaporate. Put the pot into a large copper pot
with water, observing to keep it steady, that it may not reach
to the covering of the pot that holds the marrow. As the water
shrinks, add more, boiling hot&mdash;for it must boil four hours
without ceasing a moment. Strain the ointment through a
linen cloth into small pots, and, when cold, cover them. Do
not touch it with anything but silver. It will keep many years.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>568. <em>To make Jessamine Butter.</em>&mdash;Hog's lard melted, and
well washed in fair water, laid an inch thick in a dish, and
strewed over with jessamine flowers, will imbibe the scent, and
make a very fragrant pomatum.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>569. <em>Rowland's Macassar Oil.</em>&mdash;This is made by boiling castor
oil, scenting it with oil of roses, and coloring it, while warm,
with alkanet root.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>570. <em>Macassar Oil.</em>&mdash;Common oil, three quarts; spirits of
wine, half a pint; cinnamon powder, three ounces; bergamot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
two ounces: heat them together in a large pipkin, then remove
it from the fire, and add four small pieces of alkanet root, keeping
it closely covered for several hours. Let it then be filtered
through a funnel lined with filtering paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>571. <em>Wash for the Skin.</em>&mdash;Four ounces of potash, four ounces
of rose-water, two ounces of pure brandy, and two ounces of
lemon-juice; put all these into two quarts of water, and when
you wash, put a table-spoonful or two of the mixture into the
basin of water you intend washing in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>572. <em>To make Milk of Roses.</em>&mdash;To one pint of rose-water, add
one ounce of oil of almonds and ten drops of the oil of tartar.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;Let the oil of tartar be poured in last.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>573. <em>Almond Paste.</em>&mdash;Blanch half a pound of sweet almonds
and a quarter of a pound of bitter almonds, and beat them to
powder in a mortar with half a pound of loaf sugar; then beat
them into a paste with orange-flower water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>574. <em>Almond Powder.</em>&mdash;Blanch six pounds of bitter almonds,
dry and beat them, and press from them one pint of oil; then
beat them in an iron mortar, and pass the powder through a
sieve. Keep it from air and moisture in a glass jar. Used
instead of soap for washing the hands, it imparts a singular delicacy
to their appearance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>575. <em>Violet Powder.</em>&mdash;This preparation is universally applied
for drying the skin after washing, especially at the joints, which,
if left even damp, produces chaps and chafing, often followed,
if neglected, by inflammation. Violet powder is best prepared
by mixing three parts of the best wheat starch with one of
finely-ground orris-root; the latter adds to the drying power
of the starch, and imparts, at the same time, an agreeable odor
like that of violet&mdash;hence the name of the mixture. It is also
prepared by perfuming starch with essential oils, without the
addition of orris-root: but, though the scent of the powder is
stronger, and to some more tempting to use, it is far less beneficial
in its application. The scent, acting as a stimulant to
the skin, increases rather than abates any tendency to redness.
Unperfumed powder is, therefore, the best to use, dusted over
the part with a little brush made of swan's-down, called a puff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>576. <em>Another Powder for Chaps, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Take dry hemlock
bark, powder it, by rubbing on a fine grater; then sift this
powder through gauze or muslin, and sprinkle it lightly on the
part chapped. It is a safe and certain curative.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>577. <em>Pearl White.</em>&mdash;Bismuth dissolved in aqua-fortis, is pearl
white. This, though at first it whitens, afterwards blackens
the skin, as all preparations from lead do; and therefore none
of them are safely to be used.&mdash;<em>Dr. Moyes' Lectures.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>578. <em>Pot-pourri.</em>&mdash;Put into a large china jar the following
ingredients in layers, with bay-salt strewed between the layers:
two pecks of damask roses, part in buds and part blown; violets,
orange-flowers, and jessamine, a handful of each; orris-root
sliced, benjamin and storax, two ounces of each; quarter
of an ounce of musk; quarter of a pound of angelica root,
sliced; a quart of the red parts of clove-gillyflowers; two
handfuls of lavender flowers; half a handful of rosemary flowers;
bay and laurel leaves, half a handful of each; three Seville
oranges, stuck as full of cloves as possible, dried in a cool
oven, and pounded; half a handful of knotted marjoram; and
two handfuls of balm of Gilead, dried. Cover all quite close.
When the pot is uncovered the perfume is very fine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>579. <em>A quicker sort of sweet Pot-pourri.</em>&mdash;Take three handfuls
of orange-flowers, three of clove-gillyflowers, three of damask roses,
one of knotted marjoram, one of lemon-thyme, six bay-leaves,
a handful of rosemary, one of myrtle, half of mint, one
of lavender, the rind of a lemon, and a quarter of an ounce of
cloves. Chop all, and put them in layers, with pounded bay-salt
between, up to the tip of the jar.</p>

<p>If all the ingredients cannot be obtained at once, put them in
as you get them; always throwing in salt with every new
article.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>580. <em>Hungary Water.</em>&mdash;Mix one quart of spirits of wine;
half a pint of water; and three-quarters of an ounce of oil of
rosemary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>581. <em>Lavender Water.</em>&mdash;Mix in a quart bottle three drachms
of oil of lavender; one pint rectified spirit of wine; shake them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
well together, and add an ounce of orange-flower water, an
ounce of rose-water, four ounces of distilled water, and, if you
like, two or three drachms of essence of musk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>582. <em>Rose-water.</em>&mdash;When the roses are in full bloom pick the
leaves carefully off, and to every quart of water put a peck of
them; put them in a cold still over a slow fire, and distil
gradually; then bottle the water; let it stand in the bottle
three days, and then cork it close.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>583. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Take two pounds of rose leaves, place them
on a napkin tied round the edges of a basin filled with hot
water, and put a dish of cold water upon the leaves; keep the
bottom water hot, and change the water at top as soon as it
begins to grow warm. By this kind of distillation you will
extract a great quantity of the essential oil of the roses by a
process which cannot be expensive, and will prove very beneficial.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>584. <em>Tincture of Roses.</em>&mdash;Put into a bottle the petals of the
common rose, and pour upon them spirits of wine; cork the
bottle, and let it stand for two or three months. It will then
yield a perfume little inferior to attar of roses. Common vinegar
is much improved by a very small quantity of this mixture
being added to it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>585. <em>Honey Water.</em>&mdash;One ounce of essence of bergamot,
three drachms of English oil of lavender, half a drachm of oil
of cloves, half a drachm of aromatic vinegar, six grains of
musk, one and a half pint of spirits of wine. Mix and distil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>586. <em>Honey Water.</em>&mdash;Take one pint of spirit as above, and
three drachms of essence of ambergris; shake them well daily.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>587. <em>Sweet-scented Water.</em>&mdash;Put one quart of rose-water, and
the same quantity of orange-water, into a large and wide-mouthed
glass: strew upon it two handfuls of jessamine flowers;
put the glass in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balneum mariæ</i>, or on a slow fire, and
when it is distilled, add to it a scruple of musk and the same
quantity of ambergris.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>588. <em>A very fine Scent.</em>&mdash;Take six drachms of oil of lavender,
three of the essence of bergamot, sixty drops of ambergris, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
two grains of musk. Mix these into a pint of the best rectified
spirits of wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>589. <em>To whiten the Hands.</em>&mdash;Take a wine-glassful of eau de
Cologne, and another of lemon-juice; then scrape two cakes of
brown Windsor soap, or the same quantity of pure white soap,
to a powder, and mix well in a mould. When hard, it will be
excellent for whitening the hands.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>590. <em>Camphor Cerate for Chapped Hands.</em>&mdash;The following
receipt was given to the contributor by a maid of honor to
Queen Victoria. It is an excellent one. Scrape into an <em>earthen</em>
vessel one ounce and a half of spermaceti and half an ounce of
white wax; add six drachms of pounded camphor, and four
table-spoonfuls of the best olive oil. Let it stand near the fire
till it dissolves, stirring it well when liquid. <em>Before</em> the hands
are washed, rub them thoroughly with a little of the cerate,
then wash them as usual. Putting the cerate on before retiring,
answers very well. This quantity costs about twenty-five
cents, and will last three winters. The vessel it is kept in
should be covered, to prevent evaporation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>591. <em>Paste for Chapped Hands.</em>&mdash;Mix a quarter of a pound
of unsalted lard, which has been washed in soft water, and then
in rose-water, with the yolks of two new-laid eggs, and a large
spoonful of honey. Add as much fine oatmeal or almond-paste
as will work into a paste.</p>

<p><em>Or</em>:&mdash;Blanch one pound of bitter almonds, and pound them
smooth in a marble mortar; add half an ounce of camphor,
one ounce of honey, quarter of a pound of spermaceti, pounded
and mixed with the almonds, till it becomes a smooth paste.
Put it into jars, and tie it down till wanted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>592. <em>To prevent inconvenience from Perspiration of the Hands.</em>&mdash;Ladies
who work lace or embroidery sometimes suffer inconvenience
from the perspiration on their hands; which may be
remedied, by rubbing the hands frequently with a little dry
wheaten bran.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>593. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Any of the milder kinds of soaps will be found
to answer the purpose of keeping the hands clean, soft, and as
white as nature will permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>594. <em>For preserving the Nails.</em>&mdash;One ounce of oil of bitter
almonds; one drachm of oil of tartar per deliquium; one
ounce of prepared crabs'-eyes. Mix up with essence of lemon,
to scent it.</p>

<p>La Forest recommends rubbing the nails with lemon as a
detergent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>595. <em>To whiten the Nails.</em>&mdash;Mix two drachms of diluted sulphuric
acid, one drachm of tincture of myrrh, and four ounces
of spring-water. Cleanse the nails with soap, and then dip the
fingers in the mixture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>596. <em>To remove Stains from the Hands.</em>&mdash;Dip your hands in
warm water, and rub on the stain a small portion of oxalic acid
powder and cream of tartar, mixed together in equal quantities.
Keep it in a box. When the stain disappears, wash the hands
with fine soap or almond cream. A box of this stain powder
should always be kept on hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>597. <em>To make Wash-balls.</em>&mdash;Shave thin two pounds of new
white soap into about a tea-cupful of rose-water, then pour on
as much boiling water as will soften it. Put into a brass pan
a pint of sweet oil, half an ounce of oil of almonds, half a pound
of spermaceti, and set all over the fire till dissolved; then add
the soap and half an ounce of camphor, that has first been
reduced to powder by rubbing it in a mortar, with a few drops
of spirits of wine, or lavender-water, or any other scent. Boil
ten minutes, then pour it into a basin, and stir it till it is quite
thick enough to roll into hard balls, which must then be done
immediately. If essence is used, stir it in quickly after it is
taken off the fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>598. <em>Essence of Soap, for shaving or washing hands.</em>&mdash;Take
a pound and a half of fine white soap, in thin slices, and add
thereto two ounces of salt of tartar; mix them well together,
and put this mixture into one quart of spirits of wine, in a bottle
which will hold double the quantity of the ingredients: tie a
bladder over the mouth of the bottle, and prick a pin through
the bladder; set it to digest in a gentle heat, and shake the
contents from time to time, taking care to take out the pin at
such times, to allow passage for the air from within. When
the soap is dissolved, filter the liquor through paper, to free it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
from impurities; then scent it with a little bergamot or essence
of lemon. It will have the appearance of fine oil, and a small
quantity will lather with water like soap, and is much superior
in use for washing or shaving.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>599. <em>Naples Soap.</em>&mdash;Put into a pipkin or saucepan half a
pint of ley, (strong enough to bear an egg,) with two ounces of
lamb suet and one ounce of olive oil; simmer them over a fire
until they be thick, when pour the mixture into a flat pan,
cover it with glass, and expose it to the heat of the sun for
seven weeks, stirring it once a day: the soap will then be made,
and may be perfumed with a few drops of oil of ambergris,
which should be well mixed. Put the soap into small jars,
and it will be improved by keeping.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>600. <em>Transparent Soap.</em>&mdash;Put into a bottle Windsor soap, in
thin shavings; half fill with spirits of wine, and set it near the
fire till the soap be dissolved, when pour it into a mould to cool.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>601. <em>Genuine Windsor Soap.</em>&mdash;To make this famous soap
for washing the hands, shaving, &amp;c., nothing more is necessary
than to slice the best white soap as thin as possible, melt it
in a stew-pan over a slow fire, scent it well with oil of caraway,
and then pour it into a frame or mould made for that purpose,
or a small drawer, adapted in size and form to the quantity.
When it has stood three or four days in a dry situation, cut
into square pieces, and it is ready for use. By this simple
mode, substituting any more favorite scent for that of caraway,
all persons may suit themselves with a good perfumed soap,
at the most trifling expense.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>602. <em>To make Lady Derby's Soap.</em>&mdash;Two ounces of bitter
almonds, blanched, one ounce and a quarter of tincture of benjamin,
one pound of good plain white soap, and one piece of
camphor the size of a walnut. The almonds and camphor are
to be beaten in a mortar until they are completely mixed, then
work up with them the tincture of benjamin. The mixture
being perfectly made, work the soap into it in the same manner.
If the smell is too powerful of the camphor and tincture
of benjamin, melt the soap by the fire, and the perfume will
go off. This soap has been tried by many persons of distinction,
is excellent in its qualities for cleansing the skin, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
be found greatly to assist the complexion, the ingredients being
perfectly safe.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>603. <em>To make superior Honey Soap.</em>&mdash;Cut into thin shavings
two pounds of common yellow or white soap; put it on the
fire with just water enough to keep it from burning: when quite
melted, add a quarter of a pound of honey, stirring it till it
boils; then take it off, and add a few drops of any agreeable
perfume: pour it into a deep dish to cool, and then cut it into
squares. It improves by keeping. It will soften and whiten
the skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>604. <em>Paste for Chapped Lips.</em>&mdash;Put four ounces of olive oil
into a bottle with one ounce of alkanet root; stop it up, and
set it for some days in the sun, shaking it often until it becomes
perfectly bright; then strain the oil from the alkanet, add to it
one ounce of white wax, and one ounce and a half of clarified
mutton suet: let the mixture simmer a little while over a slow
fire. When it begins to cool, mix with it a few drops of any
essential oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>605. <em>Chapped or Sore Lips.</em>&mdash;May be healed by the frequent
application of honey-water, and protecting them from the influence
of cold air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>606. <em>Lip Salve.</em>&mdash;Melt together an ounce of white wax, the
same of beef marrow, and three ounces of white pomatum, with
a small piece of alkanet root, tied in muslin; perfume, when
cool, with attar of rose or any other essence. It should be
strained while hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>607. <em>Bad Breath from Onions.</em>&mdash;A few leaves of parsley
eaten with vinegar, will prevent any disagreeable consequences
from eating onions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>608. <em>Wash for the Mouth.</em>&mdash;An excellent wash for the mouth
is made of half an ounce of tincture of myrrh and two ounces
of Peruvian bark. Keep in a phial for use. A few drops in
a glass of water are sufficient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>609. <em>Eau de Cologne.</em>&mdash;Mix essence of bergamot, lemon,
lavender, and orange-flower, of each one drachm; essence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
cinnamon, half a drachm; spirit of rosemary, and honey-water,
each two ounces; spirits of wine, one pint: let the mixture
stand two weeks, then put it in a glass retort, the body of which
immerse in boiling water contained in a vessel placed over a
lamp, while the beak of the retort is introduced into a large
reservoir (a decanter, for example): keep the water boiling,
while the mixture will distil into the receiver, which should
be covered with cold wet cloths. In this manner Cologne-water
may be obtained as good as the best Farina, at one-fourth the
price. A coffee-lamp or nursery-furnace will best answer to
boil the water.</p>

<p>The above is the most simple method of <em>distilling</em>, without
the regular <em>still</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>610. <em>To make Eau de Cologne.</em>&mdash;Rectified spirits of wine,
four pints; oil of bergamot, one ounce; oil of lemon, half an
ounce; oil of rosemary, half a drachm; oil of Neroli, three-quarters
of a drachm; oil of English lavender, one drachm; oil
of oranges, one drachm. Mix well, and then filter. If these
proportions are too large, smaller ones may be used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>611. <em>A very pleasant Perfume, and also preventive against
Moths.</em>&mdash;Take of cloves, caraway seeds, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon,
and Tonquin beans, of each one ounce; then add as much
Florentine orris-root as will equal the other ingredients put
together. Grind the whole well to powder, and then put it in
little bags, among your clothes, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>612. <em>Method of extracting Essences from Flowers.</em>&mdash;Procure
a quantity of the petals of any flowers which have an agreeable
fragrance; card thin layers of cotton, which dip into the finest
Florence or Lucca oil; sprinkle a small quantity of fine salt
on the flowers, and lay them, a layer of cotton and a layer of
flowers, until an earthen vessel or a wide-mouthed glass bottle
is full. Tie the top close with a bladder, then lay the vessel
in a south aspect to the heat of the sun, and in fifteen days,
when uncovered, a fragrant oil may be squeezed away from
the whole mass, little inferior (if roses are used) to the highly-valued
otto of roses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>613. <em>Curious small Cakes of Incense for perfuming Apartments.</em>&mdash;Take
equal quantities of lignum rhodium and anise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in powder, with a little powder of dried Seville orange-peel,
and the same of gum benzoin, or benjamin, and beat all together
in a marble mortar: then, adding some gum-dragon, or tragacanth,
dissolved in rose-water, put in a little civet; beat the
whole again together; make up this mixture into small cakes,
and place them on paper to dry. One of these cakes being
burnt in the largest apartment, will diffuse a most agreeable
odor through the whole room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>614. <em>To perfume Linen.</em>&mdash;Rose-leaves dried in the shade,
cloves beat to a powder, and mace, scraped; mix them together,
and put the composition into little bags.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>615. <em>To make an excellent Smelling-bottle.</em>&mdash;Take an equal
quantity of sal-ammoniac and unslaked lime, pound them separately,
then mix, and put them in a bottle to smell to. Before
you put in the above, drop two or three drops of the essence
of bergamot in the bottle, then cork it close. A drop or two
of ether, added to the same, will greatly improve it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>616. <em>Aromatic Vinegar.</em>&mdash;Throw into two pounds of acetic
acid one ounce each of the dried tops of rosemary and the dried
leaves of sage, half an ounce each of the dried flowers of lavender
and of bruised cloves. Let them remain untouched for
seven days; then express the liquid and filter it through paper.
This is useful in sick rooms.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>617. <em>Lavender Vinegar.</em>&mdash;Prepare a stone jar or bottle, and
to each pint of vinegar put into it, add half an ounce of fresh
lavender flowers; cover closely, and set it aside for a day or
two; then set the jar upon hot cinders for eight or ten hours;
and when cold, strain and bottle it. It is a refreshing perfume.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>618. <em>Spirit and Oil of Roses.</em>&mdash;A few drops of attar of roses,
dissolved in spirits of wine, form the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de rose</i> of the perfumers;
and the same quantity dissolved in fine sweet oil,
their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">huile antique <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'á la rose'">à la rose</span></i>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>619. <em>Essence of Musk.</em>&mdash;Mix one drachm of musk with the
same quantity of pounded loaf sugar; add six ounces of spirit
of wine: shake together, and pour off for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Musk is seldom obtained pure: when it smells of ammonia,
it is adulterated. To preserve it, it should be made quite dry;
when to be used as a perfume, it should be moistened.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>620. <em>Odeur Delectable.</em>&mdash;Mix four ounces of distilled rose-water,
four ounces of orange-flower water, one drachm of oil
of cloves, two drachms of oil of bergamot, two grains of musk,
one pint of spirits of wine. Macerate thoroughly, and add one
drachm of essence of musk. This delicious scent is a universal
favorite with the ladies of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau monde</i> in Paris.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>621. <em>Eau D'Ange.</em>&mdash;Pound in a mortar fifteen cloves and
one pound of cinnamon; put the whole into a quart of water,
with four grains anise-seed; let it stand over a charcoal fire
twenty-four hours; then strain off the liquor and bottle it.
The perfume is excellent, and will be useful for the hands, face,
and hair.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>622. <em>Shaving.</em>&mdash;The hone and razor-strop should be kept in
good condition. The German hone is best: it should be frequently
moistened with oil, and laid up in a place where it will not
readily become dry: if it be rubbed with soap, instead of oil,
previously to using, it will give additional keenness and fineness
to the edge of the razor.</p>

<p>The strop should also be kept moist with a drop or two of
sweet oil: a little crocus and oil rubbed in the strop with a
glass bottle will give the razor a fine edge; as will also a
paste made of tutty powder and solution of oxalic acid.</p>

<p>Mr. Knight, president of the Horticultural Society, has
invented the following apparatus and method of sharpening a
razor: Procure a round bar of cast steel, three inches long,
and about one-third of an inch in diameter; rub it smooth from
end to end with glass paper; next, smear over its surface a paste
of oil and the charcoal of wheat straw, and fix the steel into a
handle. To set a razor, dip it in hot water, raise its back, and
move it without pressure, in circles, from heel to point, and
back again; clean the blade on the palm of the hand, and again
dip it into hot water. This newly invented apparatus may be
purchased at any cutler's.</p>

<p>A very small piece of nitre, dissolved in water and applied
to the face after shaving, will remove any unpleasant sensation,
though the first application may be somewhat painful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>623. <em>Shaving Liquids.</em>&mdash;1. Rub in a marble mortar an ounce
of any fine soap, with two drachms of carbonate of potassa.
When these two substances are incorporated, continue rubbing,
and add gradually a pint of lavender-water, or any other odorous
water made by dissolving essential oils in alcohol sixty degrees
above proof. When the whole is well combined, filter
the liquid, and bottle it for use. To make a lather, put a few
drops into a wine-glass of tepid water; dip your brush in the
mixture, and, when rubbed on the face, a fine lather will appear.
2. Dissolve any quantity of fine soap in alcohol, either
with or without perfume. Use it according to the preceding
directions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>624. <em>An Easy Shave.</em>&mdash;The operation of shaving may be
robbed of its unpleasant sensations by rubbing the chin over
with grease, or a sweet oil, before the application of the razor.
The best razor-strop in the world is one's own hand, moistened
with its own natural oil or perspiration. Sharpen the razor
thus before you wash your hands, and you will find this natural
strop most efficacious. After shaving, to allay irritation, wash
the chin with Portugal water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>625. <em>Composition for Shaving, without the use of razor, soap,
or water.</em>&mdash;Mix one pint and a half of clear lime-water, two
ounces of gum-Arabic, half an ounce of isinglass, an eighth of an
ounce of cochineal, a quarter of an ounce of turmeric-root (made
into powder), an eighth of an ounce of salt of tartar, and an
eighth of an ounce of cream of tartar, together: boil them for
one hour at least (stirring up the mixture during the whole
time of boiling, and be careful not to let it boil over), clear it
through a sieve; then add two and a half pounds of pumice
stone, finely pulverized; mix the whole together with the hands,
by the assistance of the white of two eggs, well stirred up.
Then divide the cake into twelve small ones. Dry them in the
open air for three days; put them into an oven moderately
heated for twenty-four hours, when they will be ready for use.
Apply them, with a gentle friction, to the beard, and they will
produce the effect of shaving by rubbing off the hair.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART III.</a></h2>

<h3>HOME PURSUITS AND DOMESTIC ARTS.</h3>

<p class="hsumm center"><em>Needle-work</em>, <em>Fancy-work</em>&mdash;<em>Preparations for Writing</em>&mdash;<em>Flowers</em>&mdash;<em>House
Plants</em>&mdash;<em>Birds</em>&mdash;<em>Gold Fish</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>


<p>The first and best use of the needle is common or plain
sewing. Every woman and girl should understand this art,
the beginning of all arts, and the most indispensable to civilization.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dilate on the importance of common
needlework, and to this female accomplishment, so universally
necessary, we shall principally confine our directions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>626. <em>Requisites for Sewing.</em>&mdash;A neat work-box well supplied
with all the implements required, including knife, scissors (of
at least three sizes), needles and pins in sufficient variety, bodkins,
thimbles, thread and cotton, bobbins, marking silks, black
lead pencils, &amp;c., should be provided, and be furnished with a
lock and key, to prevent the contents being thrown into confusion
by children or unauthorized intruders.</p>

<p>The lady, being thus provided, and having her materials, implements,
&amp;c., placed in order upon her work-table, to the edge
of which it is an advantage to have a pincushion affixed by
means of a screw&mdash;may commence her work, and proceed with
it with pleasure to herself, and without annoyance to any
visitor who may favor her with a call. We would recommend,
wherever practicable, that the work-table should be made of
cedar, and that the windows of the working parlor should open
into a garden well supplied with odoriferous flowers and plants,
the perfume of which will materially cheer the spirits of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
especially, whose circumstances compel them to devote the
greatest portion of their time to sedentary occupations. If these
advantages cannot be obtained, at least the room should be
well-ventilated, and furnished with a few cheerful plants, and
a well-filled scent-jar. The beneficent Creator intended all his
children, in whatever station of life they might be placed, to
share in the common bounties of his providence; and when she,
who works not for pleasure, but to obtain the means of subsistence,
is compelled to seclude herself, for days or weeks together,
from the cheering influence of exercise in the open air,
it becomes both her duty, and that of those for whom she
labors, to secure as much of these advantages, or of the best
substitutes for them, as the circumstances of the case will
admit.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>EXPLANATION OF STITCHES.</h4>

<p>627. <em>Hemming.</em>&mdash;Turn down the raw edge as evenly as possible.
Flatten, and be careful, especially in turning down the
corners. Hem from right to left; bring the point of the needle
from the chest toward the right hand. Fasten the thread
without a knot, and when you finish, sew several stitches close
together, and cut off the thread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>628. <em>Mantua-maker's Hem.</em>&mdash;You lay the raw edge of one
of your pieces a little below that of the other; the upper edge
is then turned over the other twice, and felled down as strong
as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>629. <em>Sewing and Felling.</em>&mdash;If you have selvages, join them
together, and sew them firmly. If you have raw edges, turn
down one of the edges once, and the other double the breadth,
and then turn half of it back again. This is for the fell. The
two pieces are pinned together, face to face, and seamed together&mdash;the
stitches being in a slanting direction, and just deep
enough to hold the separate pieces firmly together. Then
flatten the seam with the thumb, turn the work over, and fell it
the same as hemming. The thread is fastened by being worked
between the pieces, and sewn over.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>630. <em>Running.</em>&mdash;Take <em>three threads, leave three</em>, and, in order
that the work may be kept as firm as possible, back-stitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
occasionally. If you sew selvages, they must be joined evenly
together; but if raw edges, one must be turned down once,
and the other laid upon it, but a few threads from the top: in
this case, it must be felled afterwards.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>631. <em>Stitching.</em>&mdash;The work must be as even as possible.
Turn down a piece to stitch to; draw a thread to stitch upon,
twelve or fourteen threads from the edge. Being thus prepared,
you take <em>two threads back</em>, and so bring the needle out from
<em>under two before</em>. Proceed in this manner to the end of the
row; and, in joining a fresh piece of thread, take care to pass
the needle between the edges, and so bring it out where the
last stitch is finished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>632. <em>Gathering.</em>&mdash;You begin by taking the article to be gathered,
and dividing it into halves, and then into quarters, putting
on pins to make the divisions. The piece to which you are
intending to gather it, must be gathered about twelve threads
from the top, taking three threads on the needle, and leaving
four; and so proceeding alternately until one quarter is gathered.
Fasten the thread by twisting it round a pin; stroke the
gathers, so that they lie evenly and neatly, with a strong needle
or pin. You then proceed as before, until all the gathers are
gathered. Then take out the pins, and regulate the gathers
of each quarter so as to correspond with those of the piece to
which it is to be sewed. The gathers are then to be fastened
on, one at a time; and the stitches must be in a slanting direction.
The part to be gathered must be cut quite even before
commencing, or else it will be impossible to make the gathering
look well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>633. <em>Double Gathering, or Puffing.</em>&mdash;This is sometimes employed
in setting on frills, and, when executed properly, has a
pretty effect. You first gather the top in the usual way; then,
having stroked down the gathers, you gather again under the
first gathering, and of such a depth as you wish the puffing to
be. You then sew on the first gathering to the gown, frock,
&amp;c., you design to trim, at a distance corresponding with the
width of the puffing, and the second gathering sewed to the
edge, so as to form a full hem. You may make a double hem,
if you please, by gathering three times instead of only twice;
and one of the hems may be straight, while the other is drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to one side a little. This requires much exactness in the execution,
but, if properly done, it gives a pleasing variety to the
work.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>634. <em>German Hemming.</em>&mdash;Turn down both the raw edges
once, taking care so to do it as that both turns may be toward
your person; you then lay one below the other, so as that the
smooth edge of the nearest does not touch the other, but lies
just beneath it. The lower one is then to be hemmed or felled
to the piece against which you have laid it, still holding it before
you. You are next to open your sleeve, or whatever else
you have been employed upon, and, laying the upper fold over
the lower, fell it down, and the work is done.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>635. <em>Binding.</em>&mdash;Various kinds of work have binding set on
to them, in preference to hemming them, or working them in
herring-bone stitch. Flannel is generally bound, sometimes
with a thin tape, made for the purpose, and called "flannel
binding." It is also common to bind flannel with sarcenet
riband. The binding is so put on as to show but little over
the edge on the right side, where it is hemmed down neatly;
on the other side it is run on with small stitches.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>636. <em>Braiding.</em>&mdash;Silk braid looks pretty, and is used for a
variety of purposes. In putting it on, it is best to sew it with
silk drawn out of the braid, as it is a better match, and the
stitches will be less perceived.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>637. <em>Marking.</em>&mdash;It is of essential importance that clothes
should be marked and numbered. This is often done with ink;
but as some, persons like to mark with silk, we shall describe
the stitch. Two threads are to be taken each way of the cloth,
and the needle must be passed three ways, in order that the
stitch may be complete. The first is aslant from the person,
toward the right hand; the second is downward toward you;
and the third is the reverse of the first&mdash;that is, aslant from you,
toward the left hand. The needle is to be brought out at the
corner of the stitch nearest to that you are about to make.
The shapes of the letters or figures can be learned from an
inspection of any common sampler.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>638. <em>Piping.</em>&mdash;This is much used in ornamenting children's
and other dresses. It is made by enclosing a card of the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
thickness in a strip of silk cut crosswise, and must be put on
as evenly as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>639. <em>Plaiting.</em>&mdash;The plaits must be as even as it is possible
to place them one against another. In double plaiting, they
lie both ways, and meet in the middle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>640. <em>To keep Thread, Sewing-silk, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;In making up linen,
thread is much preferable to cotton. Sewing-silk should be
folded up neatly in wash-leather, and colored threads and cotton
in paper, as the air and light are likely to injure them. Buttons,
hooks and eyes, and all metal implements, when not in
use, should be kept folded up, as exposure to the air not only
tarnishes them, but is likely to injure them in a variety of ways.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>INSTRUCTIONS IN THE PREPARATION OF HOUSE-LINEN.</h4>

<p>641. <em>Bedroom Linen.</em>&mdash;This includes quilts, blankets, sheets,
pillow-covers, towels, table-covers and pincushion-covers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>642. <em>Quilts.</em>&mdash;These are of various sizes and qualities, in accordance
with the purposes to which they are applied. They
are generally made of the outside material and the lining&mdash;wadding
or flannel being laid between&mdash;and stitched in diamonds
or other devices. The stitches must pass through the
whole, and the edges of the quilt are to be secured by a braiding
or binding proper for the purpose. They are best done in
a frame.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>643. <em>Blankets.</em>&mdash;These are generally bought, ready-prepared
for use. It is sometimes necessary to work over the edges at
the end, which should be done with scarlet worsted, in a very
wide kind of button-hole stitch.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>644. <em>Sheets.</em>&mdash;These are made of fine linen, coarse linen, and
cotton-sheeting. Linen sheets are best for summer, and many
prefer them at all seasons. If the sheeting is not sufficiently
wide for the bed, two lengths must be sewed together. The
seam up the middle must be sewed as neatly as possible, and
the ends may be either hemmed or seamed: the latter is the
preferable method. Sheets and all bedroom linen should be
marked and numbered; to add the date of the year is also an
advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>645. <em>Pillow-cases.</em>&mdash;These are made of fine or coarse linen,
and sometimes of cotton cloth. The material should be of such
a width as to correspond with the length of the pillow. One
yard and three nails, doubled and seamed up, is the proper size.
One end is seamed up, and the other hemmed with a broad
hem, and furnished with strings or buttons as is deemed most
convenient. We think the preferable way of making pillow
covers is to procure a material of a sufficient width, when
doubled, to admit the pillow. The selvages are then sewed together,
and the ends seamed and hemmed as before directed.
Bolster covers are made in nearly the same manner, only that
a round patch is let into one end, and a tape for a slot is run
into the other.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>646. <em>Towels.</em>&mdash;Towels are made of diaper or huckaback, of a
quality adapted to the uses to which they are applicable. They
should be one yard long and about ten or twelve nails wide.
The best are bought single, and are fringed at the ends. Others
are neatly hemmed, and sometimes have a tape-loop attached
to them, by which they can be suspended against a wall.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>647. <em>Dressing Table Covers.</em>&mdash;These may be made of any
material that is proper for the purpose. Fine diaper generally,
but sometimes dimity and muslin are employed, or the table is
covered with a kind of Marseilles quilting, which is prepared
expressly for the purpose. Sometimes the covers are merely
hemmed round, but they look much neater if fringed, or bordered
with a moderately full frill. Sometimes a worked border
is set on. All depends upon taste and fancy. A neat and
genteel appearance, in accordance with the furniture of the
apartment, should be especially regarded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>648. <em>Pincushion Covers.</em>&mdash;A large pincushion, having two
covers belonging to it, should belong to each toilet table. The
covers are merely a bag into which the cushion is slipped. They
may be either worked or plain; always of white muslin or
linen cambric; and should have small tassels at each corner,
and a frill or fringe all round.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>649. <em>Table Linen.</em>&mdash;This department of plain needlework
comprises table-cloths, dinner-napkins, and large and small tray
napkins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>650. <em>Table-cloths.</em>&mdash;These may be purchased either singly,
or cut from the piece. In the latter case the ends should be
hemmed as neatly as possible, and marked and numbered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>651. <em>Dinner Napkins.</em>&mdash;These are of various materials; if cut
from the piece, they must be hemmed at the ends the same as
table-cloths. Large and small tray napkins and knife-box
cloths, are made in the same manner. The hemming of all
these should be extremely neat. It is a pretty and light employment
for very young ladies; little girls even should do
this work, and thus early acquire habits of neatness and usefulness,
which will prove useful in after life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>652. <em>Housemaid and Kitchen Linen.</em>&mdash;In the housemaid's department,
paint cloths, old and soft, and chamber bottle cloths,
fine and soft, are to be provided. To these must be added
dusters, flannels for scouring, chamber bucket-cloths, which last
should be of a kind and color different from everything else.
All these must be neatly hemmed and run, or seamed if necessary.
Nothing, in a well-directed family, should bear the impress
of neglect, or be suffered to assume an untidy appearance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>653. <em>Clothes-bags.</em>&mdash;Clothes-bags of different sizes should
also be provided, of two yards in length, and either one breadth
doubled, in which case only one seam will be required, or of
two breadths, which makes the bags more suitable for large
articles of clothing. These bags are to be seamed up neatly at
the bottom, and to have strings which will draw run in at the
top. The best material is canvas, or strong unbleached linen.
In the kitchen department, you will require both table and
dresser cloths, which should be made as neat as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>654. <em>Mending.</em>&mdash;In cutting up an old garment, it is a great
advantage to have a portion of the same material new. For
this reason, when purchasing cloth for a new garment, buy a
little additional quantity for repairs, and take care that it is kept
for that purpose, and not wasted in any way.</p>

<p>It was formerly the custom with all careful women, when
buying a dress, to buy an extra yard for new sleeving. To be
sure a gown was then more expensive than now; but it should
be remembered, that if six gowns can be bought for the money
that used to buy three or four, they cannot be made up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
same time at home, nor for the same money if put out. Any
tolerably handy woman, though she may not choose to venture
upon cutting out and making a new dress, may repair one,
having the old pattern and lining to work by, and the very
creases and stitches for a guide. If, by so doing, a gown will
wear half as long again, the price of a little over-quantity at
first, and a few hours employed on the work, are well bestowed.</p>

<p>The same remark applies to the garments of men. Unless
these be bought ready-made, the pieces should be carefully laid
by for repairs. In children's clothing, these alterations and repairs
are often needed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>655. <em>Patchwork.</em>&mdash;Many improvements may be made in
patchwork that most of us have been accustomed to see for
years. It is a kind of needlework very interesting for little
girls; and old ladies frequently resort to this for amusement
by their cosy firesides, during the long winter evenings, when
tired of reading.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>656. <em>Of the Materials.</em>&mdash;<em>The materials</em> necessary for patchwork
are such portions of wearing apparel, whether cloth, calico,
linen, holland, silk, velvet, cotton, &amp;c., such as would otherwise
be thrown away, or saved for the rag-man. No matter
how small the portion, every scrap has its use. The next necessary
article is some stiff paper&mdash;old envelopes, backs of letters,
brown paper, &amp;c., to form the shapes; lastly, the design&mdash;shapes,
cut out in <em>tin</em>, and the designs themselves.</p>

<p>The materials should be arranged into shades and qualities.
After having been cut to required sizes, and the irregularities
of the edges neatly repaired, they are ready for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>657. <em>Patterns.</em>&mdash;The <em>patterns</em> may be varied <em>ad infinitum</em>, if
the person possesses the least talent for drawing; but for the
sake of those who may not be able to do this, we submit the
following simple and effective designs to be executed in any
of the materials.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>658. <em>To make the Patchwork.</em>&mdash;The pattern should be placed
before the person, and the shades being selected, the several
pieces arranged so as to form the design, and the edges then
neatly sewed together; after which they are either pressed, or
ironed, the papers removed, and the lining proceeded with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>When silks and velvets are employed, it improves the effect
to combine the two, taking the silk for the lighter, and the velvet
for the darker shades; or, as in figures 5, 6, 8, and 11, to
have silk for the lighter shades, and two velvets for the others,
shaded to pattern.</p>

<p>A very pretty effect is produced by combining Holland and
calico, silk and satin, silk or satin and velvet, and rough and
fine cloth.</p>

<p><em>The various articles</em> that may be manufactured, are quilts in
colored and white calico; anti-macassars in silks; ottomans in
silks and velvets, silks and cloth; table-covers in silks and
cloth; cushions for chairs or sofas, in silks; and mats, rugs, and
carpets, in cloth.</p>

<p>We have seen many useful white quilts for children's cots,
made from the cuttings remaining after shirt making. The
centre might be of Holland and calico, pattern 10, fig. 5, and
then fig. 7, with a fringe border, knitted. Numerous rugs
might be made in colored cloths, to look equal to carpets, for
poor people, and wear much better.</p>

<div class="caption">AN ELEGANT MUSNUD FOR A SOFA.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>659. <em>The materials</em> required, consist of braid of various hues,
purse-silk of different shades, bed-ticking, feathers, down, horse-hair,
or worsted ends; the design-shapes, some cord for pipings,
the various colored cloths, silks, &amp;c., and a curtain-ring or a
piece of cardboard for the centre.</p>

<p><em>The size</em> varies from fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter,
according to taste.</p>

<p><em>The colors</em> cannot be fixed, because it depends much upon
taste, but we have made the elegant musnud given <a href="#Page_160">p. 160</a>, by
placing cobalt as the right hand centre-piece, then (proceeding
from right to left) white, salmon, purple, crimson, amber, pea-green,
and madder-brown. The handles are amber, the side
brown, and the back purple.</p>

<p>It is better, in combining or arranging all colors for patchwork,
to keep as near as possible to the harmony observed by
Nature; therefore, to attend to the same order displayed in the
case of a refracted ray of light, viz., violet, indigo, blue, green,
yellow, orange, and red, adding, in this case, white, to represent
the ray in its natural state before refraction or dispersion of its
colors took place.</p>

<p><em>To make the Musnud.</em>&mdash;Cut two circles of fifteen or eighteen
inches in diameter in bed-ticking, and a strip of the same material
three inches deep, and thrice the length of the diameter;
make into the usual shape, and stuff with feathers, down, horse-hair,
or the refuse ends of worsted. Cut out two handles as in
the design, of the same material, and sew them on. Rub the
<em>inside</em> of the bed-ticking with a lump of bees'-wax previous to
making up the musnud, (as it prevents the feathers and dust
working through,) and tack the centre down.</p>

<p>Cut out the back in a piece of purple moreen, or any other
material, then cut four strips of brown cashmere, each three
inches deep and five long, join these neatly together to form
the side, and braid the following design in bright yellow on
it, finishing the veining of the leaves in chain-stitch with purse
silk.</p>

<p>The wedge-shaped pieces should now be cut out in the various
colored cloths, &amp;c., and braided as in the design, four being
braided with floral, and four with fancy designs. Each piece
should measure nine inches in length and six inches and three-quarters
in breadth at the outer part. The centre piece should
measure two inches and a quarter in diameter, be of a dark
brown, and braided with a bright yellow star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p><em>To cover the musnud</em>, sew the pieces neatly together, and
cover the joining with narrow strips of dark brown cloth,
braided in bright yellow to resemble a chain; cover the curtain
ring, or circular piece of card-board, with the central piece, and
sew it on.</p>

<p>Now affix the pipings cut crossways out of brown cloth, and
cover the handles with amber-colored material, braid and pipe
them; join the back to the side with an intervening piping, slip
the musnud into the lower covering, and sew on the top.</p>

<p>In <em>braiding</em> the patterns, the purple ground should have a
scarlet braid.</p>

<p>The brown, yellow.</p>

<p>In finishing the braiding, it will require the occasional aid of
some chain-stitch work in purse-silk, for the veinings of the
leaves, stamens, tendrils, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;This particularity in arranging <em>colors and patterns</em>
may seem very trifling to some people; but rules are required
in all finished work. Habits of attention are an important part
of education, or, rather, are indispensable to a well-trained
mind. Therefore, we say, be particular to do all you undertake
in a proper manner; and if you are making <em>patchwork</em>, aim at
perfection of its kind. But never fall in love with your own
creations, and worship them as idols; and never neglect common
household duties for fanciful needlework. Remember,
also, that <em>reading</em> is more refining to the taste than finger-work;
and that to <em>read well</em> is a much higher accomplishment than any
mere skill in counting stitches and matching shades.</p>

<h4>FOR SILK EMBROIDERY.</h4>

<p>660. <em>Useful Patterns for working in Cord, Silk, and Muslin.</em>&mdash;These
are what are called "endless patterns," to be worked in
cord.</p>

<p>These fashions for embroidering the borders of cloaks, pelisses,
sacques, &amp;c., on merino, or fine cassimere, or flannel, with silk,
are to be wrought with coarse or fine silk, or with a mixture
of the two, according to the degree of intricacy or simplicity
in the parts of the pattern.</p>

<p>We give two designs; from these, other combinations may
be made, to suit the fancy of the embroiderer.</p>

<p>662. <em>Sewing on glazed Calico.</em>&mdash;By passing a cake of white
soap a few times over a piece of glazed calico, or any other
stiffened material, the needle will penetrate as easily as through
any other kind of work.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>663. <em>To make Glass Jars to look like China.</em>&mdash;Paint figures
to resemble those in China jars, and cut them out so that none
of the white paper remains; then, with thick gum-arabic water,
fasten them to the inside of the glass. Let them stand to dry
for twenty-four hours. Then wipe off with a wet cloth the gum-arabic
on the glass between the prints, and let them stand a
few hours longer. Then take white wax and flake white, ground
very fine, and melt them together. With a japanning-brush
go over all the glass above the prints: done in this manner,
they will hold water. For a blue ground, use white wax and
Prussian blue, ground fine; for red, wax and vermilion, or carmine;
for green, wax and verdigris; for chocolate, wax and
burnt umber.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>664. <em>To give Plaster Figures the appearance of Marble.</em>&mdash;Put
into a well-glazed earthen vessel, four pounds of clear water
and one ounce of pure curd soap, grated; add one ounce of
white bees'-wax, cut into thin slices. Let them dissolve over
a slow fire. As soon as the whole is incorporated, it is fit for
use. Let the figure be thoroughly dried, then suspend it by a
twine, and dip it once into the varnish; upon taking it out, the
varnish will appear to have been absorbed; in two minutes'
time, stir the compost, and dip it a second time, which is generally
sufficient. Cover it carefully from the dust for a week;
then, with a soft muslin rag, rub the figure gently, when a most
brilliant gloss will be produced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>665. <em>To improve Plaster Casts.</em>&mdash;Brush them over with size,
and, when dry, varnish them with copal varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<h4>ANGLO-JAPANESE WORK.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-166.jpg" width="500" height="359" alt="Jewelry box in Anglo-Japanese style" />
</div>

<p>667. This elegant and most useful work is very easy in its
execution, while the means and appliances for its performance
are within the reach of every one. The materials are simply
yellow withered leaves, a little dissolved gum, black paint, and
copal varnish: while the objects to be ornamented may be a
box, cupboard, table, &amp;c., in fact, any old furniture that has
been rendered unsightly by age or long use. A plain deal box,
costing about a shilling, may by this process, so far as the outside
goes, be converted into a costly-looking dressing-case. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
exquisite chess-board may be made, with very little skill, from
a square piece of deal. Flower-pots, pole-screens, folding and
hand-screens, may all be decorated in this manner, and, from
untidy-looking lumber, may be converted into articles of use,
elegance, and beauty; and this at a merely nominal expense,
<em>taste</em> being the chief requisite in the production. The employment
forms one of the most agreeable and pleasing amusements
for summer days and winter evenings; in the summer, giving
a purpose and an aim to many a joyous ramble, for in these
desultory walks a goodly collection may be made of Nature's
ambered jewels.</p>

<p>All leaves that are small, of uneven shape, and serrated at
the edges, are well adapted for this work. As they are collected,
they should be placed between sheets of paper, but not
close together, then pressed by placing a board on the top,
with a weight upon it, to express any moisture that may be
therein, and to render them quite flat. In the autumn, the
sweet-scented geranium-leaves, the maple, thorn, chrysanthemum,
wild parsley, fern, and a multitude of others, may be
found, including the smaller sycamore and small vine-leaves;
but they must all have turned of a golden hue, or reddish-tinted
yellow. Prepare the article to be ornamented, thus:&mdash;First
rub the surface smoothly down with sand-paper; then coat it
over with black paint, which can be procured, ready-mixed,
at any oil-shop; when dry, rub it down smoothly with pumice-stone,
and give two more coats. When these are dry, arrange
the leaves on the surface in a careless manner, but not in groups,
unless preferred. Butterflies drawn, and colored yellow with
gamboge, or cut out of prints, and then colored, may be stuck
at different spaces with advantage; but there should be no
other color than the brown and different tints of yellow in the
leaves. Gum the wrong side of the leaf, and press it on in its
appointed place with a hard tuft of wadding, fastened tightly
up in a piece of silk. Continue this with the whole of the
leaves; and when they are all gummed on, dissolve some gelatine
or isinglass in warm water, and while rather warm, brush
it well over every portion of the work, using the brush entirely
one way, not forward and back. When dry, give the work
three coats of the best copal varnish, letting the article remain
a day or two between each coat. This process, though elaborate
in detail, is easily and even quickly done, and will well
repay any trouble that may be taken, as, with a renewed coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of varnish every five or six years, it will remain, as long as the
wood will hold together, as bright in appearance as when first
finished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>668. <em>Sealing Wax Varnish.</em>&mdash;For fancy work, this has, of
late years, been much used, and if well applied, and the wax
good, will be a very good imitation of India Japan. The method
of making the varnish or japan is very easy, being simply
reducing the wax to a coarse powder, and pouring the best spirits
of wine on it in a bottle, and letting it gradually dissolve without
heat, shaking the bottle occasionally till it is all dissolved.
A two-ounce stick of the best wax will be enough for a quarter
of a pint of spirits. Recollect that much depends on the goodness
of the sealing-wax; and that you may vary the color of the
varnish by using different colored wax. As this varnish dries
very quickly, it should not be made until it is wanted for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>669. <em>Method of preparing the Composition used for Colored
Drawings and Prints, so as to make them resemble Paint in Oil.</em>&mdash;Take
of Canada Balsam, one ounce; spirit of turpentine, two
ounces; mix them together. Before this composition is applied,
the drawing or print should be sized with a solution of isinglass
in water, and when dry, apply the varnish with a camel-hair
brush.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>670. <em>Oil and Water Gilding.</em>&mdash;In oil gilding, the frame is first
covered with a composition of whiting and parchment size, then
with a coating of "<em>oil gold size</em>," (a kind of varnish,) upon which
when nearly dry, gold leaf is applied.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>671. <em>In Water Gilding</em>, a size mixed with <em>water</em> is used.
Parts of the frame are burnished, other parts left <em>dead</em>. This
is the most beautiful and expensive style of gilding, but it does
not bear washing as oil gilding does.</p>

<p>["The Carver and Gilder," published by Knight, furnishes
much useful information on this subject.]</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>672. <em>To mount Prints or Maps.</em>&mdash;Upon a table, floor, or board,
stretch a piece of calico or smooth canvas, by first fixing it with
tacks along one side, then straining it tightly with one hand,
and driving the tacks with the other: nail the remaining edges,
leaving no wrinkles on the surface. Paste the back of the print<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
or map, fold it together, and let it remain until the paper is
<em>soaked</em>, then open it, and place it evenly on the canvas, cover it
with a sheet of clean paper, and beginning in the middle, rub it
down carefully with the hand, going from the centre all round
to the edges, until all the air is excluded, and the paper adheres
closely to the canvas. When quite dry, with a large camel-hair
brush lay on a coating of parchment size, repeating this
when dry: then varnish with mastic varnish. Parchment size
is made by boiling parchment cuttings in water, until it forms
a jelly when cold. Mastic varnish may be procured at oil and
color-shops.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>673. <em>New Camera Lucida.</em>&mdash;Sir John Robinson devised, a few
years since, a cheap and easily-used camera lucida, applicable
to the delineation of flowers and other small objects. A piece
of plate glass is made to stand in a vertical position by means
of a support. It rests on a table covered with white paper,
and the object is placed on the paper on one side of the glass.
On looking down from that side of the glass diagonally, an
image of the object is seen on the paper on the other side, and
a drawing of it can be readily taken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>674. <em>Varnish for Oil Pictures.</em>&mdash;According to the number of
your pictures, take the whites of the same number of eggs, and
an equal number of pieces of sugar-candy, the size of a hazel-nut,
dissolved, and mix it with a tea-spoonful of brandy; beat the
whites of your eggs to a froth, and let it settle; take the clear,
put it to your brandy and sugar, mix them well together, and
varnish over your pictures with it.</p>

<p>This is much better than any other varnish, as it is easily
washed off when your pictures want cleaning again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>675. <em>To take Impressions of Butterflies' Wings.</em>&mdash;Lay the
wings gently on paper, wet with gum arabic water, and nearly
dry; a copy will be left when the wing is removed, but inferior
in beauty to the wing itself. It is better to gum the wings
themselves on paper, and paint the body of the fly in its natural
position.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>676. <em>To preserve the Eggs of Birds.</em>&mdash;First clean them of their
contents. This may be done with the larger eggs by making
a hole on one side large enough to admit a quill, and shaking out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the contents. Then wash them well with a solution of camphor,
not too strong, or it will make them brittle. When dry, fasten
them with gum on the side in which the hole was made to a
piece of card board, and write the name under each. As the
colors of many of them are perishable, to preserve them give
them a slight coating of varnish. The best varnish for this
purpose is isinglass dissolved in gin. In cleaning the smaller
eggs, make a hole at each end, a little to one side, and blow
them. The camphor solution need not be used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>677. <em>To make Artificial Coral.</em>&mdash;Melt together four parts of
yellow resin and one part of vermilion. Dip twigs, cinders or
stones in this, and when dry they will resemble coral.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>678. <em>An Excellent Pen-Wiper for Steel Pens.</em>&mdash;Fill a short,
wide-mouthed vial with shot, the smaller the better. Whenever
it is necessary to clean the pen, rub it up and down in the
shot. This is much more effectual than cloth wipers, and the
shot will last a life-time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>679. <em>To preserve Steel Pens.</em>&mdash;Metallic pens may be preserved
from rusting by throwing into the bottle containing the
ink a few nails, or broken pieces of steel pens, if not varnished.
The corrosive action of the acid which the ink contains is expended
on the iron so introduced, and will not therefore affect
the pen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>680. <em>Black Paper for drawing Patterns.</em>&mdash;Mix and smooth
lamp-black and sweet oil; with a bit of flannel cover a sheet
or two of large writing-paper with this mixture; then dab the
paper dry with a bit of fine linen, and keep it by for using in
the following manner:&mdash;Put the black side on another sheet
of paper, and fasten the corners together with small pins. Lay
on the back of the black paper the pattern to be drawn, and
go over it with the point of a steel pencil; the black paper will
then leave the impression of the pattern on the under sheet, on
which you must draw it with ink.</p>

<p>If you draw patterns on cloth or muslin, do it with a pen
dipped in a bit of stone blue, a bit of sugar, and a little water,
mixed smooth in a teacup, in which it will be always ready for
use, if fresh: wet to a due consistence as wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>681. <em>To make Transparent Paper for Drawing.</em>&mdash;Tracing
paper is readily made by taking a sheet of very thin silk, or
other paper, and rubbing it over gently with some soft substance,
filled with a mixture of equal parts of drying oil, and
oil of turpentine, which, being suspended and dried, will be fit
for use in a few days; or it may be had at any of the shops.
Lay this transparent material on the print or drawing to be
transferred, and, with a sharp black lead pencil, trace the outlines
exactly as they appear through the paper. If more permanent
or stronger lines are wished, ink mixed with ox-gall
will be necessary to make it adhere to the oiled surface.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>682. <em>Transparent Paper.</em>&mdash;Wet some fine paper with a feather
on both sides with a thin layer of rosin, dissolved in spirits
of wine. It will then serve to put over anything you wish to
take off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>683. <em>Method of using Tracing Paper.</em>&mdash;Take a piece of the
size required, and rub it equally over, on one side, with black
lead, reduced to a powder, till the surface will not readily soil
a finger; then lay a piece of white paper with the leaded side of
this paper next to it, under the print, and securing them firmly
together with pins at the corners, proceed to take the outlines
with a blunt point, and some degree of pressure, which will transfer
the lead to the clean paper precisely in the direction the point
passed over the print; this may be corrected with the black lead
pencil, and cleansed of any soil by the crumbs of stale bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>684. <em>Method of setting Pencil Drawings.</em>&mdash;A solution of alum
water, in which the drawing is to be dipped (not washed on
with a brush, as it would smear) will answer the purpose extremely
well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>685. <em>Wash for preserving Drawings made with Black Lead
Pencil, or with hard Black Chalk.</em>&mdash;A thin wash of isinglass will
fix either black lead or hard black chalk, &amp;c., so as to prevent
their rubbing out; or the same effect may be produced by the
simple application of skimmed milk. The best way of using
the latter, is, to lay the drawing flat upon the surface of the
milk, and then, taking it up expeditiously, to hang it by the
one corner till it drains and dries. The milk must be perfectly
free from cream, or it will grease the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>686. <em>To make Red Sealing Wax.</em>&mdash;To every ounce of shell-lac
take half an ounce each of resin and vermilion, all reduced to a
fine powder. Melt them over a moderate fire; and when thoroughly
incorporated and sufficiently cool, form the composition
into what are called sticks. On account of the dearness of shell-lac,
seed-lac is usually substituted. A more ordinary sort, but
sufficiently good for most occasions, may be made by mixing
equal parts of resin and shell-lac with two parts of red lead and
one of vermilion. In a still commoner sort, the vermilion is
often entirely omitted.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>MARKING INK.</h4>

<p>687. Mix in six drachms of distilled water, two drachms of
sub-nitrate of silver, and two drachms of gum-arabic. For the
mordant, mix with four ounces of water, half an ounce of gum-arabic,
and half an ounce of sub-carbonate of soda. The article
to be marked should first be wetted with the mordant, and
pressed smooth, and should be thoroughly dried before it is
written upon. The mark should be exposed to the light for
some time, to become black.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>688. <em>Permanent Red Ink for marking Linen.</em>&mdash;This useful preparation,
which was contrived by Dr. Smellie, of Edinburgh,
who was originally a printer in that city, may be used either
with types, a hair pencil, or even with a pen: Take half an
ounce of vermillion, and a drachm of salt of steel; let them be
finely levigated with linseed oil, to the thickness or limpidity
required for the occasion. This has not only a very good appearance,
but will, it is said, be found perfectly to resist the
effects of acids, as well as of all alkaline leys. It may be made
of other colors, by substituting the proper articles instead of
vermillion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>689. <em>An Indelible Ink for marking Linen.</em>&mdash;Pour a little aqua-fortis
into a cup, and add to it a small piece of pure silver;
when the effervescence ceases, filter the solution through a piece
of blotting-paper, and put it into a small phial; then add to it
a little gum-arabic and a little of the paint, called sap-green.
After the whole is perfectly combined it is then fit for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>690. <em>To take out Writing.</em>&mdash;When recently written, ink may
be completely removed by the oxymuriatic acid (concentrated
and in solution). The paper is to be washed over repeatedly
with the acid; but it will be necessary afterwards to wash it
also with lime-water, for the purpose of neutralizing any acid
that may be left on the paper, and which would considerably
weaken it. But if the ink have been <em>long</em> written, it will have
undergone such a change as to prevent the preceding process
from taking effect. It ought therefore to be washed with liver
of sulphur (sulphuret of ammonia), before the oxymuriatic acid
is applied. It may be washed with a hair pencil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>691. <em>To make Old Writing legible.</em>&mdash;Take six bruised gall-nuts,
and put them to a pint of strong white wine; let it stand
in the sun for forty-eight hours. Dip a brush in it and wash
the writing, and by the color you will discover whether the
mixture is strong enough of the galls.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>692. <em>Sympathetic Ink.</em>&mdash;With a clean pen write on paper
with a solution of muriate of cobalt, so diluted with water, that
the writing when dry will be invisible. On gently warming
the paper, the writing will appear of a blue or greenish color,
which will disappear again when cool. A solution of muriate
of copper forms a yellow and sympathetic ink, and acetate of
cobalt a rose or purple. If a landscape be drawn representing
a winter scene, the paper being overlaid where the foliage
should be with the green sympathetic ink, then, on gently
warming the drawing, it will represent summer. Sky and
water may be drawn with the blue, and standing corn with the
yellow ink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>693. <em>Blue Ink.</em>&mdash;Dissolve a small quantity of indigo in a
little oil of vitriol, and add a sufficient quantity of water, in
which gum-arabic has been dissolved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>694. <em>Yellow Ink.</em>&mdash;Dissolve gamboge in a solution of gum-arabic.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>695. <em>Scarlet Ink.</em>&mdash;Dissolve vermilion in a solution of gum-arabic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>696. <em>Red Ink.</em>&mdash;Boil one ounce of Brazil wood in half-a-pint
of water for a quarter of an hour; add to the decoction three
drachms of gum-arabic, and an ounce of alum.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>697. <em>Green Ink.</em>&mdash;Verdigris, two ounces; cream of tartar,
one ounce; water, half a pint; boil till reduced to one half, and
filter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>698. <em>Excellent Writing Ink.</em>&mdash;Boil eight ounces of galls in
coarse powder, and four ounces of logwood in thin chips, in
twelve pints of rain water, for one hour: strain the liquor, and
add four ounces of green copperas, three ounces of powdered
gum-arabic, one ounce of blue vitriol, and one ounce of rock
candy, powdered; stir the mixture until the whole be dissolved,
then let it subside twenty-four hours; decant it very steadily,
and put it into stone bottles for use.</p>

<p>A clove kept in it will prevent it from becoming mouldy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>699. <em>Black Ink.</em>&mdash;To make one gallon, take of pounded blue
nutgalls one pound; copperas, six ounces; gum common, four
ounces; soft water, one gallon. Dissolve the gum separately
by the fire, and add, after it has boiled a quarter of an hour.
Let the ink be boiled over a slow fire three-quarters of an hour.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>700. <em>To make Ink.</em>&mdash;To four ounces of bruised galls, allow
two of copperas and two of gum-arabic; put the galls into a
large bottle, with three pints of rain water; and, in three or
four days, dissolve the gum in hot water, and add it with the
copperas. Shake the bottle frequently for some days. A few
cloves may be put into the bottle, to prevent the ink from
moulding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>701. <em>Ink Powder.</em>&mdash;Take five ounces of the cleanest nutgalls,
bruise them, and sift the powder very fine; then add one ounce
of white copperas, two ounces of Roman vitriol, gum-arabic,
half an ounce; pound and sift them very fine. An ounce of
this powder will make a pint of very black ink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>702. <em>To prevent Ink from moulding.</em>&mdash;Half-a-dozen cloves,
bruised with gum-arabic, are to be put into the bottle. If a
very fine ink is wanted, white wine, or vinegar and water,
should be used, instead of water alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>703. <em>To make Indian Ink.</em>&mdash;Put six lighted wicks into a dish
of oil; hang an iron or tin concave cover over it, so as to receive
all the smoke; when there is a sufficient quantity of soot settled
to the cover, then take it off gently with a feather upon a sheet
of paper, and mix it up with gum-tragacanth to a proper consistence.</p>

<p>N. B. The clearest oil makes the finest soot, consequently
the best ink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>704. <em>Indian Ink.</em>&mdash;Take horse-beans, burn them till they are
perfectly black, grind them to a fine powder, and, with weak
gum-arabic water make it into a paste, and form it into long
square cakes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>705. <em>To make China Ink.</em>&mdash;Take dried black horse-beans,
burn them to a powder, mix them up with gum-arabic water,
and bring them to a mass; press it well, and let it dry.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>MANAGEMENT OF CANARY-BIRDS.</h4>

<p>706. Canary-birds, that are kept tame, will breed three or
four times in the year. Towards the middle of March, begin
to match your birds, putting one cock and hen into the breeding-cage,
which should be large, so that the birds may have room
to fly and exercise themselves. Place two boxes or little
basket-nests in the cage, for the hen to lay her eggs in, because
she will sometimes have a second brood before the first are
fit to fly, leaving the care of them to the father-bird, who feeds
and brings them up with much care, while she is sitting on her
second nest of eggs. Whilst your birds are pairing, feed them,
besides the usual seeds, with the yolks of hard-boiled eggs,
bread that has been moistened, or, if hard, grated fine, and
pounded almond-meat. When the young birds are to be fed,
give the same soft food, and be sure have it fresh every day;
also furnish the old birds with fresh greens, such as cabbage-lettuce,
chick weed, groundsel, &amp;c. Give fresh water every day,
and a clean bath every morning. The hen lays, commonly,
four or five eggs, and sits fourteen days. When the young are
hatched, leave them to the care of the old birds, to nurse and
bring up till they can fly and feed themselves, which is, usually,
in about twenty days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>707. <em>Gold and Silver Fish.</em>&mdash;Pure rain-water is best to keep
these delicate little creatures in; they should never be put into
water that has been boiled. It is a good plan to throw them in
the morning into a large bowl of fresh water, with a few bread-crumbs
in it, and let them remain there an hour. Then put
them in pure fresh water in their vases. The water should be
changed every day. If the bread remains in the water to become
sour, it will kill the fish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>708. <em>Improvement in the management of Bees.</em>&mdash;The improvement
is that of having double skeps or hives, the one on the
top of the other. When the lower skep is filled with honey,
it is to be removed after the bees are admitted (through a passage
which is made to be opened) into the upper skep; into
this skep food must be put, and the bees will remain there,
and go on with their work in it. When it is filled with honey,
the former skep, with food in it, may be replaced, and the bees
again admitted into it. The full skep is then to be taken away.
This change of the skeps must always be made about midsummer;
and by thus annually removing the full one, more
honey will be collected than is usual, and the bees will not be
destroyed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>709. <em>To preserve Flowers in Water.</em>&mdash;Mix a little carbonate
of soda with the water, and it will preserve the flowers for a
fortnight. Common saltpetre is also a good preservative.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>710. <em>To preserve Flowers in Winter.</em>&mdash;Take the latest buds
just as they are ready to open; cut them off, leaving the stem
about three inches long; cover the end of the stem with melted
sealing-wax, and when the buds are a little withered, wrap them
separately in paper, and place them in a dry box. When you
wish to have the buds blossom, cut off the sealed end, and put
them into water in which a little saltpetre has been dissolved.
In twelve hours the buds will be open.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>711. <em>To take Impressions of Leaves.</em>&mdash;Dissolve in a saucerful
of water about a tea-spoonful of bichromate of potash. Pass
the paper to be used through this solution, and, while wet,
press the leaves lightly upon it, and expose it to the sun when
it is shining brightly. When perfectly dry, remove the leaves,
and a <em>fac-simile</em> will be left in a light lemon shade, while the
rest of the paper will be of a dark brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>712. <em>To preserve the natural color in Petals of dried Flowers.</em>&mdash;Immerse
the petals for some minutes in alcohol. The colors
will fade at first, but in a short time they will resume, permanently,
their natural tint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>713. <em>To revive faded Flowers.</em>&mdash;Nearly all flowers may be
revived, when faded, by placing one-third of the stalks in hot
water; when it has become cold, the flowers will be re-set and
fresh; the end of the stalks should then be cut off and the flowers
put into cold water.</p>

<p>Or, dip flowers in spirits of wine for twenty minutes; at first
they will appear to have entirely faded; but in drying, the
colors will revive, and the fragrance be prolonged.</p>

<p>A few grains of salt put into the water with flowers, will
keep them from fading.</p>

<p>Sand may be substituted for water.</p>

<p>Flowers may be preserved throughout the winter, if plucked
when they are half-blown, dipped, stalks downward, in equal
quantities of water and verjuice mixed, and sprinkled with bay
salt. They should be kept in an earthenware vessel, closely
covered, and in a warm place; when, in mid-winter, if the
flowers be taken out, washed in cold water, and held before a
gentle fire, they will open as if in their first bloom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>714. <em>To paint Cloth, Cambric, Sarcenet, &amp;c., so as to render
them Transparent.</em>&mdash;Grind to a fine powder three pounds of
clear white resin, and put it into two pounds of good nut-oil,
to which a strong drying quality has been given: set the mixture
over a moderate fire, and keep stirring it till all the resin
is dissolved; then put in two pounds of the best Venice turpentine,
and keep stirring the whole well together; and if the cloth
or cambric be thoroughly varnished on both sides with this
mixture, it will be quite transparent. In this operation, the surface
upon which the varnish is to be applied, must be stretched
tight and made fast during the application. This mode of rendering
cloth, &amp;c. transparent, is excellently adapted for window-blinds.
The varnish will likewise admit of any design in oil-colors
being executed upon it as a transparency.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>715. <em>Varnish to prevent the rays of the Sun from passing
through the glasses of Windows.</em>&mdash;Pulverize gum-tragacanth,
and put it to dissolve for twenty-four hours in whites of eggs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
well beaten. Lay a coat of this on the panes of your windows,
with a soft brush, and let it dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>716. <em>To stain paper or parchment Yellow.</em>&mdash;Paper may be
stained of a beautiful yellow, by the tincture of turmeric, formed
by infusing an ounce or more of the root, powdered, in a pint
of spirit of wine. This, by the addition of water, may be made
to give any tint of yellow, from the lightest straw to the full
color called French yellow, and will be equal in brightness
even to the best dyed silks. If yellow is wanted of a warmer
or redder cast, anotta, or dragon's blood, must be added to the
tincture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>717. <em>To stain paper or parchment Crimson.</em>&mdash;A very fine
crimson stain may be given to paper, by a tincture of the
Indian lake, which may be made by infusing the lake some
days in spirit of wine, and then pouring off the tincture from
the dregs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>718. <em>To stain paper or parchment Green.</em>&mdash;Paper or parchment
may be stained green by the solution of verdigris in
vinegar, or by the crystals of verdigris dissolved in water;
also by the solution of copper in aquafortis, made by adding
filings of copper, gradually, to the aquafortis, till no ebullition
ensues; or, the spirit of salt may be substituted for the aquafortis.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HOUSE-PLANTS.</h4>

<p>719. Plants require much light and fresh air; a light garret
is an excellent place for them; even those which will not bear
the outer air, must have the air of the room frequently freshened
by ventilation, to preserve them in health. They should
not stand in a draught of air. In frosty weather the windows
should be kept close, and at night, the shutters. In sharp frost,
instead of stirring out the fire, leave a little on retiring to rest,
with a guard before it for security.</p>

<p>As a general rule, never water plants while the sun shines.
The time should be in the evening, or early in the morning, unless
it be confined to watering the roots, in which case transplanted
plants, and others in a growing state, may be watered
at any time; and, if they are shaded from the sun, they may
also be watered over the tops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The water, if taken from a well or cold spring, should be exposed
one day to the sun, otherwise it will chill the plants. A
small quantity only should be applied at a time, that it may
have the effect of refreshing rain.</p>

<p>Rain water is the best for plants; next river water; hard
spring water is the worst.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>720. <em>To air Plants, and ventilate Rooms wherein they are contained.</em>&mdash;Plants
should have air, every day in the year, to make
them grow well; but this matter, in sitting-rooms, will not of
course be regulated for their sakes, especially in the colder seasons.
Wherever placed, however, some attention should be
paid to airing and ventilating the rooms regularly, by opening
the windows, and occasionally the doors, in order to excite a
free circulation of air. This should be done to a certain extent
every day, according to the state of the weather, except in the
time of severe frost, when it would not be advisable to admit
external air. But at such times, if bad weather be of long
continuance, the rooms may be ventilated by means of the
doors, and by exciting a current of air in the passages, or other
parts of the house.</p>

<p>In very severe frost, or in a continuation of damp weather,
moderate fires should be made for the sake of the plants, if
placed in rooms not occupied. The window shutters should
also be closed at night.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>721. <em>Hints to Lovers of Flowers.</em>&mdash;A most beautiful and
easily-attained show of evergreens may be had by a very simple
plan, which has been found to answer remarkably well on
a small scale. If geranium branches taken from luxuriant and
healthy trees, just before the winter sets in, be cut as for slips,
and immersed in soap-water, they will, after drooping for a few
days, shed their leaves, put forth fresh ones; and continue in the
finest vigor all the winter. By placing a number of bottles
thus filled in a flower-basket, with moss to conceal the bottles,
a show of evergreens is easily insured for the whole season.
They require no fresh water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>722. <em>Bulbous Roots.</em>&mdash;The time to put bulbous roots, as the
hyacinth, narcissus, and jonquil, into glasses filled with water,
is from September to November, and the earliest will begin
blooming about Christmas. The glasses should be blue, as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
color best suits the roots; put in water enough to cover the
bulb one third; let the water be soft, change it once a week,
and put in a pinch of salt at each change. Keep the glasses in
a moderately warm place, and near to the light.</p>

<p>They should have fresh water about once in ten days. The
leaves should not be plucked off before they decay, or the root
will be deprived of much of its natural nourishment. When
they have decayed, the bulbs should be taken up, laid in the
shade to dry, cleaned, and kept in sand in a dry place till wanted
to replant. The offsets should be taken off, and planted according
to size.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>723. <em>Geraniums.</em>&mdash;The shrubby kinds are commonly increased
by cuttings, which, if planted in June or July, and
placed in the shade, will take root in five weeks. They are the
most tender, and when placed out of doors, should be defended
from strong winds, and be so placed as to enjoy the sun till
eleven o'clock in the morning. As the shrubby kinds grow
fast, so as to fill the pots with their roots, and push them
through the opening at the bottom, they should be moved every
two or three weeks in summer, and the fresh roots cut off.
They should also be newly potted twice in the summer: once
about a month after they are placed abroad, and again towards
the end of August. When this is done, all the roots outside
the earth should be pared off, and as much of the old earth removed
as can be done without injuring the plants. They
should then be planted in a larger pot; some fresh earth should
first be laid at the bottom, and on that the plant should be
placed, so that the old earth adhering to it may be about an
inch below the rim of the pot; it should next be filled up, and
the pot slightly shaken: the earth must then be gently pressed
down at the top, leaving a little space for water to be given
without running over the rim; finally, the plant should be liberally
watered, and the stem fastened to a stake, to prevent the
wind displacing the roots before they are newly fixed.</p>

<p>As the branches grow, and new leaves are formed at the top
of them, the lower ones may die, and should be plucked off
every week.</p>

<p>Geranium slips should be planted in May, June, or July,
taking only the last year's shoots, from which the leaves must
be stripped. When planted, give them water, and place them
in the shade: when they have taken root, let them have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sun in the morning. The slips chosen for cutting should not
be such as bear flowers; and they should be inserted about
half their length in the earth.</p>

<p>Geraniums, except the shrubby kinds, require shelter from
frost only, and should have free air admitted to them, when
the weather is not very severe. In sultry weather, they should
all be watered liberally every morning, except some few of a
succulent nature, which must be watered sparingly; the latter
may be known by plucking a leaf from them. Geraniums
may be watered three times a week, when not frosty, in
winter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>724. <em>Artificial Mould for Plants.</em>&mdash;Russian potash, one
drachm; water, four ounces; one tea-spoonful of oil. Mix the
whole well together. Seeds put in this mixture will grow for
a time at least, as well as if planted in common soil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>725. <em>To take Impressions of Plants.</em>&mdash;Take half a sheet of
fine paper, and cover the surface with sweet oil; let it stand a
minute or two, then rub off the superficial oil, and hang the
paper in the air; when almost dry, move the paper slowly
over the flame of a candle or lamp, till it is perfectly black;
lay on it the plant or leaf, place a piece of clean paper over,
and rub it equally with the fingers for half a minute. Then
place the plant on the paper or scrap-book where it is desired
to have the impression, cover it with blotting paper, and, on
repeating the rubbing, a representation of the plant will appear
equal to the finest engraving. The same piece of black paper
will serve for a number of impressions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>726. <em>Another Process.</em>&mdash;Burn a common cork till reduced to
powder; mix with it a tea-spoonful of olive oil, making a thick
paste. Paint the veiny side of the leaf with a camel-hair
brush, and lay it, with the painted side down, on a piece of
clean paper. Submit it to a strong and even pressure (it is
best placed in a book and put under a weight,) for about fifteen
minutes; remove the leaf carefully, and there will be an exact
representation left. Very veiny leaves are best. These impressions
are almost equal to engravings. Collections of them
might be made interesting, by having narratives of rambles
written under them, stating the features of the spot from which
the leaves were gathered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DIRECTIONS FOR WINDOW-PLANTS.</h4>

<p>727. <em>Through January and February.</em>&mdash;The summer flowering-plants&mdash;such
as geraniums, fuchsias, &amp;c.&mdash;should be kept
as nearly dormant as possible, allowing just enough water to
prevent flagging, and all the light that can be spared from the
more interesting division of winter-bloomers; of the latter class,
such things as china-roses, cinerarias, hyacinths and other bulbs,
will now be in an active state, some of them flowering, and
others about to do so; these must be liberally treated with
water. Mignonnette, however, must be excepted. Above everything,
keep the leaves clean; they are few in number, and feeble
in action, but they have yet an important function to perform;
and, without they are kept as healthy as possible, the plant
cannot begin a new growth with the vigor it is desirable it
should possess. The pots should be occasionally scrubbed with
clean water, but do not paint or otherwise fill up their pores,
for air is as essential to the roots as to the foliage, and no
inconsiderable quantity finds its way to them through the sides
of a clean pot. With the same view, the surface of the soil
should be frequently stirred; the process keeps it open, prevents
the growth of moss and weeds, and imparts a better appearance.
The water given should always be rather warmer
than the atmosphere of the room; and rain-water, slightly heated,
is the best.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>728. <em>March.</em>&mdash;The whole of these plants will be benefited by
re-potting. Geraniums and fuchsias delight in light rich earth;
calceolarias (lady's slipper), roses, the chimney campanula, and
others which grow as freely, should have a larger proportion of
loam; whatever manure is added for either, must be thoroughly
decayed. The pots should be perfectly clean, inside and out;
take care to have each properly drained with pieces of slate or
potsherds, in size and number proportionate to the pot; the
larger ones require from one to three inches of this drainage.
In removing the plants, take off the matted fibres with a knife;
loosen the soil moderately, and, when in its place, press the new
earth tightly round it; give a gentle watering, and keep them
rather warm for a few days; afterwards they should have plenty
of air on fine days, and water as they become dry. Station
each where it may receive the direct light, and pay particular
attention to keeping the leaves clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>729. <em>April.</em>&mdash;On the attention given through this month,
most of the success for the season will depend. The plants are
now, or ought to be, in a very active growth, which must be
encouraged by moderate and regular supplies of water and air.
Pinch out the points of the growing shoots of such plants as
are required to become bushy; this is commonly called "stopping,"
and, with such things as geraniums, fuchsias, myrtles,
and others of similar habit, is very necessary. Cactuses must
have a sunny position, and plenty of water. Mignonette in
pots and boxes, will require thinning, so as to leave the plants
about three inches apart. The several kinds of China roses
form beautiful window ornaments, and occasion but little trouble:
at this time they are coming rapidly into bloom. Look
for and destroy insects of all sorts, every few days; they multiply
so fast, that without constant attention, the plants are
soon overrun. The leaves must be kept clear of dust, and the
branches properly tied out to sticks, that the centre may receive
its due share of light.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>730. <em>May.</em>&mdash;As the influence of the advancing season and
power of the sun begins to be felt, the management of window-plants
becomes easier, and must be gradually changed from
the careful nursing hitherto necessary, to a course of almost
constant exposure that will render the plants robust and hardy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>731. <em>June.</em>&mdash;From this time till the middle of September,
plants in pots may be placed out of doors; they are, in fact,
better in the open air, than in the heated atmosphere of a room.
Except in stormy seasons, they may stand out night and day,
in some slightly-sheltered spot. As a precaution against the
effects of strong sun-light, it is advisable to place the pots in
which the plants grow, into others a size or two larger, and fill
the space between them with moss; for many plants, having
slender fibrous roots, are easily injured by the heat of the sun
scorching them through the pot. Such as stand upon the ground,
should have a thick layer of ashes spread for them, to prevent
worms from creeping in. Wash their leaves frequently with
clean water, and remove insects. When any portion of the
collection is kept in-doors, a window facing the north or west
is to be preferred, and plenty of air must be admitted. As
soon as geraniums have done flowering, they should be cut
down, re-potted, and the tops struck, to form plants for next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
year. This is a good time to propagate nearly all kinds of
pot-plants; most of them strike with freedom on a warm border
in sandy soil, covered with a glass, and kept moderately watered.
Myrtles, and some other hard-wooded plants, may be
struck by placing the cuttings, for about half their length, into
a phial filled with water. Seeds must be sown in light earth,
as soon as they are thoroughly ripe.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>732. <em>July.</em>&mdash;Fuchsias, in a growing state, should receive a
final potting: place them in large, perfectly clean pots, using
a mixture of turfy loam and peat, or leaf mould; train the
shoots, and water liberally. Geraniums that have done flowering,
should also be re-potted; they require a lighter soil, such
as one part turfy loam, two parts leaf mould, and the remainder
sand: cut down the tops to within two or three joints of their
base, and set the plants in a warm sheltered place, to induce
them to grow again: the cuttings may be struck in a frame or
hand-glass, and will form nice plants by next season. Cactuses
should be kept in a sunny situation, and have plenty of water.
Camellias which have made their season's growth, may be set
out of doors, to ripen. China roses may be re-potted, if requisite,
and are easily propagated now, in the same manner as
geraniums. Separate and pot violets, for early spring-flowering;
keep them and similar plants, as the cyclamen, &amp;c., in the most
shaded place out of doors. The whole tribe of lilies are handsome
window-plants, and some of the dwarf Japan kinds peculiarly
adapted for the purpose; they are just beginning to
bloom, and should have plenty of air and water. The Chinese
primrose may be sown in pots of light rich earth, and, if covered
with a piece of glass, will vegetate quickly, and form nice
plants by the autumn. Propagation of such plants as myrtles,
sweet-scented verbena, or lemon plant, chimney campanulas,
&amp;c., is now easy, and should be attended to without loss of
time. Water all the plants with regularity, and in quantities
proportionate to their size and the state of the weather; but
particularly keep the leaves clean, by frequent sprinklings of
clean water and sponging. The essential points in the culture
of every plant, is to allow the functions of both roots and leaves
to be carried on in a proper manner&mdash;the first, by placing them
in suitable soil, and the latter, by clearing them of all impurities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>733. <em>August.</em>&mdash;Needs only a continuance of the attention
recommended last month. Let them have plenty of air, light,
and water, with a slight protection from the mid-day sun; propagation
may still be carried on successfully. Pot the bella-donna
and Guernsey lilies, to flower in autumn; and the young
plants of the Chinese primrose should be placed three or four
together, in pots of light rich earth, and nursed, to forward their
growth as far as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>734. <em>September.</em>&mdash;The geraniums cut down in July, will now
be pushing forth a number of young shoots; these must be encouraged
as much as possible, by keeping the plants in a sheltered
place, and duly supplying them with moisture. When
the shoots have grown two or three joints, they should be stopped
by picking out the points, in order to render them bushy.
The cuttings made at the same period will now be fit for potting;
put each one separately into a small pot, and treat them as the
older plants. Young plants of myrtles, and indeed all others that
are properly rooted, should receive similar treatment. Cinerarias
are among the most useful of spring-flowering plants, and
if a few seedlings can be obtained now, they will make nice
plants, with the treatment recommended for geraniums. Cyclamen,
Guernsey, or Bella-donna lilies, and Lachenalias should be
re-potted; the first and last are very handsome spring-flowering
plants, and the lilies are exceedingly beautiful through October
and November; all of them are of reasonable price, and well
worth adding to the usual stock of window plants. Fill a few
pots with fibrous loam, and sprinkle them over with mignonette,
<span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'nemophilla'">nemophila</span> insignis, and intermediate stocks; leave the pots in
the open air, and thin the plants to about three or four of the
strongest, as soon as they can be handled. Pot off china primroses,
putting one plant into each three-inch pot. Encourage
the chrysanthemums in pots with alternate applications of manure
water, repot the strongest, and allow them all plenty of
room, or the leaves are liable to injury. Set all plants as they
grow out of flower in the sun, to ripen their wood, but do not
let them suffer from drought.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>735. <em>October.</em>&mdash;The principal endeavor among this class of
plants must now be directed towards getting them into a state
of rest; water very cautiously, giving air whenever the weather
will permit, and at all times let them enjoy whatever sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
occurs, and uninterrupted light. Now that the respiring power
of the leaves becomes lessened, it is most essential that every
particle of dust be carefully removed; the surface of the soil in
which they grow should be occasionally stirred, to keep it clean
and porous, and even the outside of the pots should be washed,
for the same end. If it be necessary to stand the pots in saucers,
when the plants are watered, the waste which runs through
should be regularly emptied away, as much mischief ensues
from allowing the roots to remain in the water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>736. <em>November.</em>&mdash;The directions given last month must be
closely observed throughout the remainder of the year. The
great object being to keep the majority of the plants in a resting
condition, that they may start the more vigorously on the
return of genial weather. Winter, or early spring-flowering
plants, such as violets, China primroses, cyclamen, and roses,
are, however, to be excepted from this rule; they are now in
an active state, and must be encouraged accordingly. As soon
as hyacinths and other bulbs, placed in pots last month, have
become pretty well rooted, they may be brought into the window,
and being placed near the light, will grow rapidly; those
in glasses should have the water changed once or twice a week.
Chrysanthemums in pots require plenty of water while in
bloom, and when their beauty declines, the plants should be
taken to a warm part of the garden, or placed in a light shed,
to complete their maturity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>737. <em>December.</em>&mdash;If the geraniums or other plants taken from
the borders in autumn, exhibit signs of rottenness, remove the
decaying parts, and dust the wounds with quick-lime or sulphur,
keep them comparatively dry and as much exposed to
the sun as possible; air is essential whenever it can be admitted.
Remember previous directions regarding the employment
of pans; they are a most fatal source of disease and death
when left with water in them. Water sparingly, keep the
leaves clean, and wait patiently. Flowering plants must still
form the exception, as mentioned last month.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>738. <em>To manage a Watch.</em>&mdash;<em>First</em>: Wind your watch as
nearly as possible at the same hour every day. <em>Secondly</em>: Be
careful that your key is in good condition, as there is much
danger of injuring the machine when the key is worn or cracked;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
there are more mainsprings and chains broken through a jerk
in winding, than from any other cause, which injury will,
sooner or later, be the result, if the key be in bad order.
<em>Thirdly</em>: As all metals contract by cold, and expand by heat,
it must be manifest, that to keep the watch as nearly as possible
at one temperature, is a necessary piece of attention.
<em>Fourthly</em>: Keep the watch as constantly as possible in one position&mdash;that
is, if it hangs by day, let it hang by night against
something soft. <em>Fifthly</em>: the hands of a pocket-chronometer
or duplex watch, should never be set backwards; in other
watches this is a matter of no consequence. <em>Sixthly</em>: The glass
should never be opened in watches that set and regulate at the
back. One or two other directions more, it is of vital importance
that you bear in mind. On regulating a watch, should it
be fast, move the regulator a trifle towards the slow, and if
going slow, do the reverse; you cannot move the regulator too
slightly or too gently at a time, and the only inconvenience that
can arise is, that you may have to perform the duty more than
once. On the contrary, if you move the regulator too much at
a time you will be as far, if not farther than ever, from attaining
your object; so that you may repeat the movement until
quite tired and disappointed&mdash;stoutly blaming both watch and
watch-maker, while the fault is entirely your own. Again, you
cannot be too careful in respect of the nature and condition of
your watch-pocket; see that it be made of some material that
is soft and pliant&mdash;such as wash-leather, which is the best; and,
also, that there be no flue or nap that may be torn off when
taking the watch out of the pocket. Cleanliness, too, is as
needful here as in the key before winding; for if there be dust
or dirt in either instance, it will, you may rely upon it, work
its way into the watch, as well as wear away the engine turning
of the case.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_IV" id="PART_IV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART IV.</a></h2>

<h3>DOMESTIC ECONOMY, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTH
KNOWING.</h3>

<p class="hsumm center"><em>Of the different kinds of Tea, Coffee, &amp;c.&mdash;Preserving Fruits,
Flowers, &amp;c.&mdash;Care of Fires&mdash;and other Hints.</em></p>

<h4>TEAS.</h4>

<p>739.&mdash;The names of the different kinds of tea, relate to the
time of their being gathered, or to some peculiarity in their
manufacture. It is a general rule, that all tea is fine in proportion
to the tenderness and immaturity of the leaves. The
quality and value of the different kinds diminish as they are
gathered later in the season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Teas.</span>&mdash;As soon as the leaf-bud begins to expand,
it is gathered to make <em>Pekoe</em>. A few days' later growth produces
black-leaved Pekoe. The next picking is called <em>Souchong</em>;
as the leaves grow larger and more mature, they form <em>Congou</em>;
and the last picking is <em>Bohea</em>.</p>

<p><em>Bohea</em> is called by the Chinese, <em>Ta-cha</em> (large tea), on account
of the maturity and size of the leaves; it contains a larger proportion
of woody fibre than other teas, and its infusion is of a
darker color and coarser flavor.</p>

<p><em>Congou</em>, the next higher kind, is named from a corruption
of the Chinese <em>Koong-foa</em> (great care, or assiduity). This forms
the bulk of the black tea imported, and is mostly valued for
its strength.</p>

<p><em>Souchong&mdash;Seaou-choong</em> (small, scarce sort), is the finest of
the stronger black tea, with a leaf that is generally entire and
curly. It is much esteemed for its fragrance and fine flavor.</p>

<p><em>Pekoe</em> is a corruption of the Canton name, <em>Pak-ho</em> (white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
down), being the first sprouts of the leaf-buds; they are covered
with a white silky down. It is a delicate tea, rather deficient
in strength, and is principally used for flavoring other teas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>740. <span class="smcap">Green Teas.</span>&mdash;The following are the principal kinds:
<em>Twankay</em>, <em>Hyson-Skin</em>, <em>Hyson</em>, <em>Gunpowder</em>, and <em>Young Hyson</em>.</p>

<p><em>Young Hyson</em> is a delicate young leaf, called in the original
language, <em>Yu-tsien</em> (before the rains), because gathered in the
early spring.</p>

<p><em>Hyson</em>, from the Chinese word <em>He-tchune</em>, which means,
flourishing spring. This fine tea is gathered early in the season,
and prepared with great care and labor. Each leaf is picked
separately, and nipped off above the footstalk, and every separate
leaf is rolled in the hand. It is much esteemed for its
flavor.</p>

<p><em>Gunpowder Tea</em> is only Hyson rolled and rounded, to give it
the <em>granular</em> appearance whence it derives its name. The Chinese
call it <em>Choo-cha</em> (pearl tea).</p>

<p><em>Hyson-Skin</em> is so named from the Chinese term, in which
connection <em>skin</em> means the refuse, or inferior portion. In preparing
Hyson, all leaves that are of a coarse yellow, or imperfectly
twisted appearance, are separated, and sold as <em>skin-tea</em>,
at an inferior price.</p>

<p><em>Twankay</em> is the last picking of green tea, and the leaf is not
rolled or twisted as much as the dearer descriptions. There is
altogether less trouble bestowed on the preparation.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>COFFEE.</h4>

<p>741.&mdash;The infusion or decoction of the roasted seeds of the
coffee-berry, when not too strong, is a wholesome, exhilarating,
and strengthening beverage; and, when mixed with a large
proportion of milk, is a proper article of diet for literary and
sedentary people. It is especially suited to persons advanced
in years. People who are bilious and liable to costiveness,
should abstain from it. When drank very strong, it proves
stimulating and heating in a considerable degree, creating thirst
and producing watchfulness. By an abusive indulgence in this
drink, the organs of digestion are impaired, the appetite is destroyed,
nutrition is impeded, and emaciation, general debility,
paralytic affections, and nervous fever, are brought on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>742. <em>Proper method of making Toast and Water, and the
advantages resulting therefrom.</em>&mdash;Take a slice of fine and stale
loaf-bread, cut very thin&mdash;as thin as toast is ever cut&mdash;and let
it be carefully toasted on both sides, until it be <em>completely
browned all over</em>, but nowise blackened or burned in any way.
Put this into a common deep stone or china jug, and pour over
it, from the tea-kettle, as much clean boiling water as you wish
to make into drink. Much depends on the water being actually
in a boiling state. Cover the jug with a saucer or plate, and
let the drink cool until it be quite cold; it is then fit to be used.
The fresher it is made the better, and of course the more agreeable.
The above will be found a pleasant, light, and highly-diuretic
drink. It is peculiarly grateful to the stomach, and
excellent for carrying off the effects of any excess in drinking.
It is also a most excellent drink at meals, and may be used in
the summer-time, if more agreeable to the drinker.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>743. <em>Baked Milk.</em>&mdash;Put half a gallon of milk into a jar, and
tie it down with writing-paper. Let it stand in a moderately
warm oven about eight or ten hours. It will then be of the
consistence of cream. It is used by persons who are weak or
consumptive.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>744. <em>Substitute for Cream, in Tea or Coffee.</em>&mdash;Beat the white
of an egg to a froth, put to it a very small lump of butter, and
mix well. Then turn the coffee to it gradually, so that it may
not curdle. If perfectly done, it will be an excellent substitute
for cream. For tea, omit the butter, using only the egg. This
might be of great use at sea, as eggs can be preserved fresh in
various ways.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>745. <em>Economical use of Nutmegs.</em>&mdash;If a person begin to grate
a nutmeg at the <em>stalk</em> end, it will prove hollow throughout;
whereas the <em>same</em> nutmeg, grated from the <em>other</em> end, would
have proved sound and solid to the last. This circumstance
may thus be accounted for:&mdash;The centre of a nutmeg consists
of a number of fibres issuing from the stalk, and its continuation
through the centre of the fruit; the other ends of which fibres,
though closely surrounded and pressed by the fruit, do not adhere
to it. When the stalk is grated away, those fibres, having
lost their hold, gradually drop out, and the nutmeg appears
hollow: as more of the stalk is grated away, others drop out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in succession, and the hollow continues through the whole nut.
By beginning at the contrary end, the fibres above-mentioned
are grated off at their core end, with the surrounding fruit, and
do not drop out and cause a hole.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>746. <em>To ascertain the quality of Nutmegs.</em>&mdash;Oil of nutmegs
being of great value, it is often extracted from the nuts which
are exposed to sale, and which are thereby rendered of very
little value. To ascertain the quality of nutmegs, force a pin
into them; and if good, however dry they may appear, the oil
will be seen oozing out all round the pin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>747. <em>Essence of Nutmeg.</em>&mdash;Is made by dissolving one ounce
of the essential oil in a pint of rectified spirits. It is an expensive
but invaluable mode of flavoring, in the arts of the cook
or confectioner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>748. <em>To make Essence of Celery.</em>&mdash;Soak for a fortnight half
an ounce of the seeds of celery in one gill of brandy. A few
drops will flavor a pint of soup or broth equal to a head of
celery.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>749. <em>Tincture of Lemon-peel.</em>&mdash;Fill a wide-mouthed pint bottle
half full of brandy; when a lemon is used, pare off the rind
very thin, and put it into the brandy. In two weeks the spirit
will be strongly impregnated with the flavor of the lemon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>750. <em>To test the purity of Spirits.</em>&mdash;See if the liquor will
burn away entirely: or, place a hollow ivory-ball in it; the
deeper the ball sinks, the lighter the liquor, and consequently
more spirituous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>751. <em>To purify Olive Oil.</em>&mdash;Turn the oil into a crock or bottle,
and pour in a quantity of pure water; shake the vessel vigorously,
and let it stand two hours. The mucilaginous matter
which is the cause of rancidity, will be separated from the oil,
and remain in the water. The oil can be decanted, and re-bottled
for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>752. <em>To preserve Eggs.</em>&mdash;The most simple and easy mode of
preserving eggs, is to rub the outside of the shell, as soon as
gathered from the nest, with a little butter, or any other grease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that is not fetid. By filling up the pores of the shell, the evaporation
of the liquid part of the egg is prevented; and either
by that means, or by excluding the external air, which Fourcroy
supposes destroys the milkiness which most people are
fond of in new-laid eggs, that milkiness will be preserved for
mouths, as perfect as when the egg was taken from the nest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>753. <em>Cream preserved in Long Voyages.</em>&mdash;Mix with a quantity
of fresh rich cream half its weight of white sugar in powder;
stir the whole well together, and preserve it in bottles well
corked. In this state it is ready to mix with tea or coffee, and
has continued in good condition during a voyage to America.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>754. <em>To preserve Hazel Nuts in great perfection for many
months.</em>&mdash;Hazel nuts may be kept a long time in full kernel by
burying them in earthen pots, well closed, a foot or two in the
ground. They keep best in gravelly or sandy places.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>755. <em>Easy Method of preserving Animal Food.</em>&mdash;Fresh meat
may be kept for nine or ten days perfectly sweet and good, in
the heat of summer, by lightly covering the same with bran,
and hanging it in a high and windy room; a cupboard full of
small holes, or a wire safe, is recommended to be placed in
such a room, to keep away the flies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>756. <em>To purify Lemon-juice.</em>&mdash;Add one ounce of pulverized,
well burnt charcoal, to a quart of lemon-juice; after standing
twelve hours, filter the juice through white blotting-paper; it
will keep good several years in a cellar, in a bottle, well
corked; a thick crust will form beneath the cork, and the mucilage
will fall to the bottom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>757. <em>To detect Copper in Liquids.</em>&mdash;Spirit of hartshorn mixed
with them, turns them blue. Therefore tea is not dried on copper,
as an infusion of it is not turned blue by this mixture.
Cider, being passed through brass pots, is detected by this experiment.&mdash;<em>Dr.
Moyes' Lectures.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>758. <em>To detect the Mixture of Arsenic.</em>&mdash;A solution of blue
vitriol dropped into any liquid in which arsenic has been put,
will turn it green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>759. <em>To test Mushrooms.</em>&mdash;Rub the upper skin with a gold
ring or any piece of gold: the part rubbed will turn yellow if
it is a <em>poisonous fungus</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>760. <em>To prepare Salt.</em>&mdash;Set a lump of salt in a plate before
the fire, and when dry, pound it in a mortar, or rub two pieces
of salt together; it will then be free from lumps, and in very
fine powder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>761. <em>To make Cheap and Good Vinegar.</em>&mdash;To eight gallons
of clear rain water, add three quarts of molasses; turn the mixture
into a clean tight cask, shake it well two or three times,
and add three spoonsful of good yeast, or two yeast cakes.
Place the cask in a warm place, and in ten or fifteen days, add
a sheet of common wrapping-paper, smeared with molasses, and
torn into narrow strips, and you will have good vinegar. The
paper is necessary to form the "mother," or life of the liquor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>762. <em>To prevent Mouldiness.</em>&mdash;The best preventive is any of
the essential oils, as the oil of lavender, cloves, peppermint, &amp;c.
Russia leather, which is scented with the tar of the birch-tree,
is not subject to mouldiness, and books bound in it will even
prevent mouldiness in other books bound in calf, near which
they happen to lie.</p>

<p>Aromatic seeds are not subject to mould, and gingerbread,
or cakes containing caraway seeds are far less liable to mouldiness
than plain bread. Children have been poisoned by eating
mouldy bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>763. <em>To keep Fruits.</em>&mdash;To preserve fruits, you must keep
them in a room rather above the ground floor, sheltered alike
from the sun and damp; it is even prudent, in order to avoid
opening the windows, to let out the humid exhalations of the
fruit, to have a stove in the room, and light a fire in it now and
then. The decaying fruit should be carefully removed. Cherries,
grapes, &amp;c., are kept sound by hanging them to threads,
and then inclosing them in new boxes or barrels; these are
closed as tightly as possible, and deposited in a dry place.
Some preserve them by laying them in sawdust or bran.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>764. <em>To preserve Apples.</em>&mdash;Dry a glazed jar perfectly well,
put a few pebbles in the bottom; fill the jar with apples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cover it with a bit of wood made to fit exactly; and over that,
put a little fresh mortar. The pebbles attract the damp of the
apples. The mortar draws the air from the jar, and leaves the
apples free from its pressure, which, together with the principle
of putrefaction which the air contains, are the causes of decay.
Apples, kept thus, have been found quite sound, fair, and juicy,
in July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>765. <em>To keep Potatoes from frost.</em>&mdash;If you have not a convenient
store-place for them, dig a trench three or four feet deep,
into which they are to be laid as they are taken up, and then
covered with the earth taken out of the trench, raised up in the
middle like the roof of a house, and covered with straw, to
carry off the rain. They will be thus preserved from the frost,
and can be taken up as they are wanted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>766. <em>To dry Corn for winter use.</em>&mdash;Sweet corn is the best.
Husk it. Have a pot of boiling water&mdash;put in your corn and
let it boil three minutes&mdash;then cut it from the cobs and put it
in pans in a warm oven. It must be stirred frequently; when
perfectly dry put it away in bags. When wanted for use, soak
it all night, next day boil it an hour with a little salt; before it
is dished stir in flour, pepper, and butter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>767. <em>To preserve Aromatic and other Herbs.</em>&mdash;The boxes and
drawers in which vegetable matters are kept should not impart
to them any smell or taste; and more certainly to avoid this,
they should be lined with paper. Such as are volatile, of a
delicate texture, or subject to suffer from insects, must be kept
in well covered glasses. Fruits and oily seeds, which are apt
to become rancid, must be kept in a cool and dry, but by no
means in a warm or moist place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>768. <em>To dry Herbs.</em>&mdash;Dry the gathered crop, thinly spread
out, and shaded from the sun; tie the herbs in small bundles,
and keep them compactly pressed down and covered with white
paper. Or, after drying them, put each sort into a small box,
and by means of boards, of the size of the interior length and
width of the box, and a screw-press, press the herbs into cakes,
or little trusses. These should be afterwards carefully wrapped
up in paper, and be kept in a dry place, when they will retain
their aroma as perfectly as when they were put into the press,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for, at least, three years. By the common mode of hanging up
herbs in loose bundles, the odor soon escapes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>769. <em>To dry Chamomile Flowers.</em>&mdash;Pull them, from time to
time, as they are produced; for the plants continue to blossom
in succession for several months. When gathered, dry them
gradually, partly in the sun, and partly in the shade, by being
spread upon a mat or sheet, removed out of the sun in the heat
of the day, and placed in it mornings and evenings.</p>

<p><em>Lavender Flowers</em> should also be dried as chamomiles.</p>

<p><em>Marigold Flowers</em>, dried, improve broths and soups, however
much they may have got into disuse.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>770. <em>Winter Herbs.</em>&mdash;The best time for gathering herbs for
winter use is when they are in blossom. If left till they are in
seed, the strength goes to the seed. They are best picked
from the stocks, dried quickly (but not burnt), before the fire,
and rubbed into powder, then bottled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>771. <em>Galvanism a Protector of Trees.</em>&mdash;A German journal
states that the application of galvanism has been made in Austria
for preserving trees and plants from the ravages of insects.
The process is very simple, consisting only in placing two
rings, one of copper, the other of zinc, attached together, around
the tree or plant. Any insect that touches the copper receives
an electric shock, which kills it or causes it to fall to the
ground.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>772. <em>Moss on Trees.</em>&mdash;The following is an excellent application
to the scraped trunk to prevent the growth of moss, and
destroy eggs of insects. One gallon of soft soap, one pound
of flour of sulphur, and one quart of salt, to be well stirred together
and put on with a hard brush.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>773. <em>To destroy Caterpillars in Gooseberry Trees.</em>&mdash;Gather dust
from any turnpike road, and shake it well among the trees, and
the caterpillars will immediately fall to the ground. It is an
excellent plan to dust the trees twice or three times a week, as
it will effectually prevent the lodgment of caterpillars.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>774. <em>A neat method of Grafting.</em>&mdash;Prepare the stock and the
graft in the same way as for grafting with clay in the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
way. Then take a long slip of India-rubber, three-quarters of
an inch broad, and about the thickness of a shilling. Tie one
end of this elastic riband with a thread, well prepared by rubbing
with shoemakers' wax, to the stock, a little below where
it is cut for being joined to the graft; then make the joint as
neatly as possible, and wrap it round with the riband, taking
due care to keep the India-rubber fully stretched, and to make
it overlap at each turn fully one-half of the breadth of the previous
round, till the whole is covered, then tie the top with a
thread in the same manner as at the bottom, and the operation
is finished. After grafting the trees in the manner described,
nothing is done to them till they are completely set, when the
India-rubber slips are taken off to be ready again for the next
year. When opened up, there is scarcely any appearance of a
joint, and altogether they are much neater than when done with
clay.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>775. <em>To Kill Vermin on Plants.</em>&mdash;Tobacco water is much
used for the above purposes; it is made by pouring a gallon
of boiling water upon a pound of tobacco leaves, and straining
it in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Or, syringe the plants with this mixture: put into a jar five
gallons of spring water and four ounces of chloride of lime, to
which add four ounces of vitriol; when the lime is precipitated,
pour off the clear solution, and keep it air-tight.</p>

<p>Or, mix coal tar and water, and sprinkle it over the infected
plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>776. <em>To Propagate Plants.</em>&mdash;It may be received as a general
principle, that all plants which produce shoots may be propagated
by cuttings; though some plants are much more difficult
to propagate in this manner than others. Generally speaking,
all the soft-wooded plants which have abundance of sap, such
as geraniums, fuchsias, petunias, and verbenas, strike root
readily. The usual mode for striking cuttings is to put them
in fine sand, and to cover them with a bell-glass. Some cuttings
which are difficult to strike are directed to have bottom
heat; that is, the pots in which they are planted should be
plunged into a hot-bed, that the stimulus afforded by the heat
may induce the cuttings to throw out roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>777. <em>Plants watered by being placed in Dishes, improper.</em>&mdash;The
practice of placing flats or saucers under plants, and feeding
them by the roots, that is, pouring the water continually into
these dishes, and never on the earth at top, is highly improper.
The water should always be poured on the surface of the earth,
that it may filter completely through it, to the benefit and refreshment
of the fibres.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>778. <em>When to plant Annual and Perennial Flowers.</em>&mdash;Many
kinds of annuals and perennials, sown in March and the beginning
of April, will be fit for transplanting about the end of
May, and may either be planted in patches about borders, or
in beds, as fancy shall direct. Of these, the kinds improved by
transplanting are, amaranthuses, China asters, columbines,
French and African marigolds, fox-gloves, hollyhocks, India
pinks, love-lies-bleeding, mallows, mignonette, prince's
feather, scabious, stocks, sun-flowers, sweet-williams, wall-flowers,
and others. They should be planted out in a showery
time, if possible, or otherwise be frequently watered, till they
have struck root.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>779. <em>To preserve Flower Seeds.</em>&mdash;Those who are curious
about saving flower-seeds must attend to them in the month of
August. Many kinds will begin to ripen apace, and should be
carefully sticked and supported, to prevent them from being
shaken by high winds, and so partly lost. Others should be
defended from much wet; such as asters, marigolds, and generally
those of the class Syngenesia; as from the construction
of their flowers they are apt to rot, and the seeds to mould, in
bad seasons. Whenever they are thought ripe, or indeed any
others, in wet weather, they should be removed to an airy
shed or loft, gradually dried, and rubbed or beat out at conveniency.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>780. <em>Easy Method of discovering whether or not Seeds are sufficiently
ripe.</em>&mdash;Seeds, when not sufficiently ripe, will swim, but
when arrived at full maturity, they will be found uniformly to
fall to the bottom; a fact that is said to hold equally true of
all seeds, from the cocoa-nut to the orchis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HINTS TO FARMERS.</h4>

<p>781. There are some things that all farmers ought to know.</p>

<p>Sheep put into fresh stubble are apt to be killed by eating
too much grain.</p>

<p>A bare pasture enriches not the soil, nor fattens the animals,
nor increases the wealth of the owner.</p>

<p>One animal well fed is of more value than two poorly kept.</p>

<p>The better animals can be fed, and the more comfortable they
can be kept, the more profitable they are&mdash;and all farmers work
for profit.</p>

<p>Ground once well plowed is better than thrice poorly.</p>

<p>Bountiful crops are more profitable than poor ones. Make
the soil rich, pulverize it well, and keep it clean, and it generally
will be productive.</p>

<p>Weeds that grow unmolested around the fences, stumps, and
stones, scatter their seeds over the farm, and are very likely to
increase.</p>

<p>Cows well fed in winter give more milk in summer. An ox
that is in good condition in the spring, will perform more
labor, and stand the heat of summer much better than one that
is poor.</p>

<p>When you see the fence down, put it up: if it remains until
to-morrow, the cattle may get over.</p>

<p>What ought to be done to-day, do it; for to-morrow it may
rain.</p>

<p>A strong horse will work all day without food, but keep him
at it, and he will not last long.</p>

<p>A rich soil will produce good crops without manure, but
keep it at it, and it will tire.</p>

<p>Farmers' sons had better learn to hold the plow, and feed
the pigs, than measure tape and count buttons.</p>

<p>Young ladies who have the good fortune to become farmers'
wives will find it more profitable to know how to make Johnny-cake,
butter, and cheese, than to play on the piano.</p>

<p>All who wish to be rich, must spend less than they earn.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>MANAGEMENT OF A HORSE.</h4>

<p>782. When a horse is brought in hot, loosen the girth, and
allow the saddle to remain on for five minutes. Let him be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
walked about in summer, and, in the winter, be put directly
in the stable.</p>

<p>A horse should not be permitted to drink cold water, whilst
warm; neither should the legs or feet of a horse be washed,
until he gets cold.</p>

<p>Horses prefer soft water, and it is best for them. If the
water be very hard and brackish, put a small piece of chalk
into a pail of water, some time before it is given to the horse.</p>

<p>Fourteen pounds of hay in one day, or one hundred pounds
a week, with three feeds of corn a day, are sufficient for a horse
that is not over-worked.</p>

<p>In travelling, after the principal feed, let a horse have not
less than two hours' rest, that his food may have time to digest.</p>

<p>After a hard day's work, give a horse about two gallons of
gruel, made with a quart of oatmeal, half a gallon of ale, half
a quartern of brandy, and the proper quantity of water. Wetted
bran may be given advantageously to lean horses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>783. <em>To dress a Horse.</em>&mdash;On entering the stable, first give him
about a gallon of clean water in a clean pail; then shake up
the best litter under the manger, sweep out the stall, and clean
out the stable.</p>

<p>Whilst the horse is feeding, <em>dress</em> him: first, curry him all
over with the currycomb, to loosen the dirt and dust on his
skin; then remove the dust with a whalebone brush; next,
smooth and cleanse the coat with a wisp of straw; and again
use the brush and currycomb, to take off what dust may remain;
after which, whisk him again with a damp lock of hay; and,
finally, rub him down with a woollen or linen cloth.</p>

<p>Then turn round the horse in the stall, brush his head well,
and wisp it clean and smooth with a damp lock of hay. Then
wipe the dust and filth from the inside of the ears with a damp
sponge, and draw the ears through the hands for a few minutes,
until they are warm. Wash out the sponge, and with it cleanse
the dust, &amp;c., from the eyes; sponge the nostrils, and then rub
the whole head with a cloth, in the same manner as the body.</p>

<p>Next, turn the horse round into his proper situation, put on
the head-stall, and with a sponge wash the dirt and filth from
under the tail. Then, clean and lay the mane with a comb and
water-brush, used alternately with both hands; again wipe over
the head and body, put on the body-clothes, and fasten them
with a surcingle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Examine the heels, pick out the dirt from the feet, and wash
the heels with a brush and plenty of water. If the horse has
bad feet, they should be dressed and stuffed.</p>

<p>Lastly, shake hay into the rack; and then the horse will be
completely dressed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>784. <em>Horse Flies.</em>&mdash;To prevent horses being teased with flies,
take two or three small handfuls of walnut leaves, upon which
pour two or three quarts of soft cold water; let it infuse one
night; pour the whole next morning into a kettle, and let it
boil for a quarter of an hour: when cold, it will be ready for
use. Nothing more is required than to moisten a sponge with
the liquid, and, before the horse goes out of the stable, let those
parts which are most irritable be smeared over with the liquor,
namely, between and upon the ears, the flank, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>785. <em>To milk Cows.</em>&mdash;A cow should be milked <em>clean</em>. Not
a drop, if it can be avoided, should be left in the udder. It
has been proved that the half-pint that comes out <em>last</em>, has
<em>twelve times</em>, I think it is, as much butter in it, as the half-pint
that comes out <em>first</em>. The udder would seem to be a sort of
milk-pan, in which the cream is uppermost, and, of course, comes
out last, seeing that the outlet is at the bottom. But, besides
this, if you do not milk clean, the cow will give less and less
milk, and will become dry much sooner than she ought.&mdash;<em>Cobbett.</em></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>RAISING POULTRY.</h4>

<p>786. There is scarcely any branch of farming operations more
productive than the raising of poultry for market; and yet,
with a large majority of our agriculturists, it is considered of
but little account. The proximity to a great market, and the
facilities for reaching it possessed by many of our farmers in
this country, should make the rearing of poultry an object of
attention.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>787. <em>To fatten Poultry.</em>&mdash;Poultry should be fattened in coops,
and kept very clean. They should be furnished with gravel,
but with no water. Their only food, barley-meal, mixed so
thin with water, as to serve them for drink. Their thirst makes
them eat more than they would, in order to extract the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that is among the food. This should not be put in troughs
but laid upon a board, which should be clean washed every
time fresh food is put upon it. It is foul and heated water
which is the sole cause of the pip.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>788. <em>Method of expeditiously fattening Chickens.</em>&mdash;Take, for
that purpose, a quantity of rice, and grind or pound it into a
fine flour; mix sufficient for present use with milk and a little
coarse sugar; stir the whole well over the fire, till it makes a
thick paste; and feed the chickens, in the day-time only, by
putting as much of it as they can eat, but no more, into the
troughs belonging to their coops. It must be eaten while warm;
and, if they have also beer to drink, they will soon grow very
fat. A mixture of oatmeal and treacle, combined till it crumbles,
is said to form a food for chickens, of which they are so
fond, and with which they thrive so rapidly, that at the end of
two months they become as large as the generality of full-grown
fowls fed in the common way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>789. <em>Method of fattening Geese and Ducks.</em>&mdash;Geese, the more
quiet and undisturbed they are kept, the faster and better they
fatten. Put young geese into a place that is almost dark; feed
them with ground malt mixed with milk, and they will very
soon, and at very little expense, be fit to kill.</p>

<p>Another way is cheaper still:&mdash;Mix barley-meal, pretty thick,
with water, which they must constantly have by them, to eat
as they choose; in another part of the shed where they are,
keep a pan with some boiled oats and water, for them to resort
to when they are inclined to change their food. This variety
is agreeable to them, and they thrive apace, being so fattened
at less expense than in any other manner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>790. <em>Cobbett's method of fattening Geese.</em>&mdash;Geese are raised
by <em>grazing</em>: but, to fat them, something more is required.
Corn of some sort, or boiled Swedish turnips, or carrots, or
white cabbages, or lettuces, make the best fatting. The modes
that are resorted to by the French for fatting geese, are, I hope,
such as Englishmen will never think of. He who can deliberately
inflict <em>torture</em> upon an animal, in order to heighten the
pleasure his palate is to receive in eating it, is an abuser of the
authority which God has given him, and is, indeed, a tyrant in
his heart. Who would think himself safe, if at the <em>mercy</em> of
such a man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>791. <em>Swedish method of raising Turkeys.</em>&mdash;As soon as the
young turkeys leave the shell, they are made to swallow one
or two pepper-corns, and returned to their mother. They are
afterwards fed with crumbs of bread and milk, and with common
dock-leaves, chopped small, and mixed with fresh buttermilk,
and kept in a warm place or sunshine, and guarded from
the rain or from running among nettles.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, is more useful for them than the common
garden pepper-cress, or cut-leaved cress. They are very fond
of it; and, supplied with as much of it as they will eat, they
will not be delicate in their other food.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>792. <em>To fatten Turkeys as they do in Norfolk.</em>&mdash;The quality
and size of the Norfolk turkeys are superior to those of any
other part of England. They are fed almost entirely with
buckwheat; and give them with it boiled oats, boiled malt, or
boiled barley, and sometimes, for change, even boiled wheat
and water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>793. <em>To fatten Ducks.</em>&mdash;Feed them with the same food as
the turkeys or geese, and let them have a pan of water to
dabble in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>794. <em>To make Hens lay perpetually.</em>&mdash;Hens will lay perpetually,
if treated in the following manner:&mdash;Keep no roosters
(cocks): give the hens fresh meat, chopped up like sausage-meat,
once a day; a very small portion, say half an ounce a day
to each hen, during the winter, or from the time insects disappear
in the fall till they appear again in the spring. Never
allow any eggs to remain in the nest for what are called "nest
eggs." When the roosters do not run with the hens, and no
nest eggs are left in the nest, the hens will not cease laying
after the production of twelve or fifteen eggs, as they always do
when roosters and nest eggs are allowed; but continue laying
perpetually. The only reason why hens do not lay in winter
as freely as in summer, is the want of animal food, which they
get in summer in abundance, in the form of insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HINTS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HUMAN LIFE FROM FIRE.</h4>

<p>795. <em>Cautions.</em>&mdash;Sweep chimneys regularly; sweep frequently
the lower part of the chimney within reach; the kitchen
chimney should be swept once a month.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>796. <em>Fires in Chimneys.</em>&mdash;When a chimney or flue is on fire,
throw into the fire-place handfuls of flour of sulphur, which will
destroy the flame. Or, apply a wet blanket, or old carpet, to
the throat of the chimney, or over the front of the fire-place.
A chimney-board, or register-flap, will answer the same purpose,
by stopping the draught of air from below.</p>

<p>Beware of lights near combustibles; of children near fires
and lights; and do not trust them with candles. Do not leave
clothes to dry by the fire unwatched, either day or night; do
not leave the poker in the fire; see that all be safe before you
retire to rest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>797. <em>Persons in Danger.</em>&mdash;When <em>a fire</em> happens, put it out in
its earliest stage; if suffered to extend itself, give the alarm.
Beware of opening doors, &amp;c., to increase the fire by fresh air.
Muster the whole family, see that none are missing. First save
lives, then property. Think of the ways of escape; by the
stairs, if no better way&mdash;creep along a room where the fire is,
and creep down stairs backwards on hands and knees&mdash;(heated
air ascends); come down stairs with a pillow before your
face, and a wet blanket round the body, and hold your breath;
or try the roof of the adjoining house. Throw out of the window
a feather bed, to leap upon in the last extremity&mdash;fasten
fire-escapes to the bed-posts first&mdash;send children down by the
sack fastened to a rope, taking care of the iron spikes and area;
then lower yourselves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>798. <em>Means of Extinction.</em>&mdash;The safety of the inmates being
ascertained, the first object at a fire should be the exclusion of
all fresh and the confinement of all burnt air&mdash;<em>suffocate</em> the
flames&mdash;and remember that burnt air is as great, if not a greater
enemy to fire than water. For both purposes, of excluding the
one air, and confining the other, all openings should be kept as
carefully closed as possible. The prevailing practice of <em>breaking
windows</em> is peculiarly mischievous. The only excuse for
this is the admission of water; but if the firemen were provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with self supporting ladders, (that need not lean against the
wall,) they might direct the water-hose through a single broken
pane, with ten times more accuracy than by their random
squirting from the street. Water should be made to beat out
the fire by its impetus; sprinkling is useless.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>799. <em>Neighbors and Spectators.</em>&mdash;When a fire happens, let
every <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'respectabte'">respectable</span> neighbor attend. Send instantly for engines,
both of the parish and of the insurance companies, and the parish
and other ladder and fire-escapes. Look for the nearest fireplug&mdash;send
instantly for policemen, and see they attend, and
are active.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>800. <em>Method of escape from Fire.</em>&mdash;The following simple machine
ought always to be kept in an upper apartment. It is
nothing more than a shilling or eighteen-penny rope, one end
of which should always be made fast to something in the chamber,
and at the other end should be a noose to let down children
or infirm persons, in case of fire. Along the rope there
should be several knots, to serve as resting places for the hands
and feet of the person who drops down by it. No family occupying
high houses should ever be without a contrivance of
this kind.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>801. <em>To make Water more efficacious in extinguishing Fires.</em>&mdash;Throw
into a pump, which contains fifty or sixty buckets of
water, eight or ten pounds of salt or pearlashes, and the water
thus impregnated will wonderfully accelerate the extinction of
the most furious conflagration. Muddy water is better than
clear, and <em>can</em> be obtained when salt and ashes cannot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>802. <em>To extinguish Fires speedily.</em>&mdash;Much mischief arises from
want of a little presence of mind on these alarming occasions.
A small quantity of water, well and immediately applied, will
frequently obviate great danger. The moment an alarm of fire
is given, wet some blankets well in a bucket of water, and
spread them upon the floor of the room where the fire is, and
afterwards beat out the other flames with a blanket thus wet.
Two or three buckets of water thus used early, will answer
better than hundreds applied at a later period. Linen thus
wet will be useful, but will not answer so well as woollen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>803. <em>To escape from or go into a House on fire.</em>&mdash;Creep or
crawl with your face near the ground, and, although the room
be full of smoke to suffocation, yet near the floor the air is
pure, and may be breathed with safety. The best escape from
upper windows is by a knotted rope; but, if a leap is unavoidable,
then the bed should be thrown out first, or beds prepared
for the purpose.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>804. <em>Hints respecting Women's and Children's Clothes catching
fire.</em>&mdash;The woman and children in every family should be
particularly told and shown, that flame always tends upwards;
and, consequently, that as long as they continue erect, or in
an upright posture, while their clothes are burning, the fire
generally beginning at the lower part of the dress, the flames
meeting additional fuel, as they rise, become more powerful
in proportion; whereby the neck and head, being more exposed
than other parts to the intense and concentrated heat, must
necessarily be most injured. In a case of this kind, where the
sufferer happens to be alone, and cannot extinguish the flames
by <em>instantly throwing the clothes over the head, and rolling or
lying upon them</em>, she may still avoid great agony, and save her
life, <em>by throwing herself at full-length on the floor, and rolling
herself thereon</em>. This method may not extinguish the flame,
but, to a certainty, will retard its progress, prevent fatal injury
to the neck and head, and afford opportunity for assistance;
and it may be more practicable than the other, to the aged and
infirm. A carpet or hearth-rug instantly lapped round the head
and body, is almost a certain preventive of danger.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>805. <em>Method of rendering all sorts of Paper, Linen, and Cotton,
less combustible.</em>&mdash;This desirable object may be, in some
degree, effected, by immersing these combustible materials in
a strong solution of alum-water; and, after drying them, repeating
this immersion, if necessary. Thus, neither the color nor
the quality of the paper will be in the least affected; on the
contrary, both will be improved: and the result of the experiment
may be ascertained, by holding a slip of paper, so prepared,
over a candle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>806. <em>To extricate Horses from fire.</em>&mdash;If the harness be thrown
over a draught, or the saddle placed on the back of a saddle
horse, they may be led out of the stable as easily as on common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
occasions. Should there be time to substitute the bridle for the
halter, the difficulty towards saving them will be still further
diminished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>807. <em>Method of rendering assistance to persons in danger of
Drowning.</em>&mdash;This desirable object appears attainable by the
proper use of a man's hat and pocket-handkerchief, which (being
all the apparatus necessary) is to be used thus:&mdash;Spread the
handkerchief on the ground, and place a hat, with the brim
downwards, on the middle of the handkerchief; and then tie
the handkerchief round the hat as you would tie up a bundle,
keeping the knots as near the centre of the crown as may be.
Now, by seizing the knots in one hand, and keeping the opening
of the hat upwards, a person, without knowing how to swim,
may fearlessly plunge into the water with what may be necessary
to save the life of a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>If a person should fall out of a boat, or the boat upset, by
going foul of a cable, &amp;c., or should he fall off the quays, or
indeed fall into any water from which he could not extricate
himself, but must wait some little time for assistance&mdash;had he
presence of mind enough to whip off his hat, and hold it by the
brim, placing his fingers withinside the crown, and hold it so,
(top downwards), he would be able, by this method, to keep
his mouth well above water till assistance should reach him.
It often happens that danger is descried long before we are
involved in the peril, and time enough to prepare the above
method; and a courageous person would, in seven instances
out of ten, apply to them with success; and travellers, in fording
rivers at unknown fords, or where shallows are deceitful,
might make use of these methods with advantage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>808. <em>To prevent excessive Thirst, in cases of emergency at Sea,
in the summer-time.</em>&mdash;When thirst is excessive, as is often the
case in summer-time, during long voyages, avoid, <em>if possible,
even in times of the greatest necessity</em>, the drinking of salt water
to allay the thirst; but rather keep thinly clad, and frequently
dip in the sea, which will appease both hunger and thirst for a
long time, and prevent the disagreeable sensation of swallowing
salt water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>809. <em>Best mode of avoiding the fatal Accidents of Open Carriages.</em>&mdash;Jumping
out is particularly dangerous, (the motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of the gig communicating a different one to the one you give
yourself by jumping), which tends very much to throw you on
your side or head. Many suppose it very easy to jump a little
forward, and alight safe: they will not find it so on trial. The
method of getting out behind the carriage, is the most safe of
any, having often tried it when the horse has been going very
fast. Perhaps it is best to fix yourself firm, and remain in the
carriage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>810. <em>Recovery from Suffocation, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;There are many occasions
of danger, on which a person who can hold breath for a
minute or two, may save the life of another. The best preparation
for rendering such assistance is, by breathing deep, hard,
and quick, (as a person would do after running,) and ceasing
with his lungs full of air; he will then find himself able to hold
his breath more than twice as long as he would without such
preparation.</p>

<p>If in a brewer's fermenting vat, or an opened cess-pool, one
man sinks senseless and helpless, from breathing the foul air,
another man of cool mind would, by the above preparation,
have abundant time, in most cases, to descend by the ladder or
bucket, and rescue the sufferer, without any risk to himself.
In entering a room on fire, a knowledge of this fact may be
useful.</p>

<p>The following precautions should also be regarded. Avoid
all unnecessary exertion; go coolly and quietly to the spot
where help is required; do no more than is needful, leaving the
rest to be done by those in a safe atmosphere.</p>

<p>In case of <em>choke-damp</em>, as in a brewer's vat, hold the head as
high as may be: in case of a fire in the room, keep the head
as low as possible.</p>

<p>If a rope be at hand, fasten it to the person who is <em>giving</em>
help, that he may be succored, if he venture too far. Many
deaths happen in succession in cess-pools, and similar cases, for
want of this precaution.</p>

<p>It is hardly needful to say, do not try to breathe the air of
the place where help is required. Yet many persons fail, in
consequence of forgetting this precaution. If the temptation to
breathe be at all given way to, the <em>necessity</em> increases, and the
helper himself is greatly endangered. Resist the tendency, and
retreat in time.</p>

<p>Be careful to commence giving aid with the lungs <em>full</em> of air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
not empty; for the preparation consists chiefly in laying up for
the time, in the lungs, a store of that pure air which is so essential
to life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>811. <em>Thunder Storms.</em>&mdash;The safest situation during a thunder-storm
is the cellar; for when a person is below the surface of
the earth, the lightning must strike it before it can reach him,
and will probably be expended on it. Dr. Franklin advises
persons apprehensive of lightning to sit in the middle of a room,
not under a metal lustre, or any other conductor, and to place
their feet upon another chair. It will be still safer, he adds, to
lay two or three beds or mattresses in the middle of the room,
and to place the chairs upon them. A hammock suspended
with silk cords would be an improvement on this apparatus.
Persons out of doors should avoid trees, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The distance of a thunder-storm and its consequent danger
can easily be estimated. As light travels at the rate of 192,000
miles in a second of time, its effects may be considered as instantaneous
within any moderate distance. Sound is transmitted
at the rate of only 1142 feet in a second. By observing,
therefore, the time which intervenes between the flash of lightning
and the thunder which accompanies it, a very near calculation
may be made of its distance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>812. <em>Stroke of Lightning.</em>&mdash;Throw cold water upon them as
soon as possible. It will often restore persons struck by lightning
when apparently insensible, or even dead.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>813. <em>A few Concise Rules for the Recovery of Persons apparently
Drowned.</em>&mdash;The body on being taken out of the water,
should be conveyed to the nearest house, <em>in the gentlest manner
possible</em>; the wet clothes must be removed, and the body well
dried with a towel; it must then be placed on a mattress, laid
on a table of proper height and length. Care must always be
taken to lay the head considerably higher than the extremities,
and to place the body on the right side. The lungs should be
inflated with a pair of bellows, not forcibly, but gradually, so
as to imitate the action of respiration.</p>

<p>Do not place the body in a high degree of heat; (below 98
degrees of Fahrenheit's scale is the best temperature,) clear the
apartment of all supernumerary persons, and let the windows
and doors be open, to admit a free circulation of air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Apply friction, <em>after the lungs have been expanded</em>, with the
hand only, or with a little oil on the fingers.</p>

<p>No injections are necessary, nor emetics, except in particular
cases: <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'bleedng'">bleeding</span> is also a doubtful remedy: electricity, <em>in judicious
hands</em>, may prove highly beneficial.</p>

<p>Let no rolling of the body be used with a view of emptying
it of water; there is no water present, or scarcely any. The
heart being overloaded with blood, may be burst by this injudicious
proceeding, and more mischief has been done by tossing
and rolling the body, than by any other erroneous treatment.
Hot water, in bottles, may be applied to the feet and ankles,
as soon as respiration commences: when the blood begins to
circulate, heat may be gradually increased, and the patient removed
to a warm bed, where he must be carefully watched till
the action of the heart be completely restored.</p>

<p>The following way is commended by those who have seen it
tried: 1. Lose no time. 2. Handle the body gently. 3.
Carry the body with the head gently raised, and never hold it
up by the feet. 4. Send for medical assistance immediately,
and in the mean time act as follows: 1. Strip the body, rub
it dry; then rub it in hot blankets, and place it in a warm bed
in a warm room. 2. Cleanse away the froth and mucus from
the nose and mouth. 3. Apply warm bricks, bottles, bags of
sand, &amp;c., to the arm-pits, between the thighs and the soles of
the feet. 4. Rub the surface of the body with the hands enclosed
in warm dry worsted socks. 5. If possible, put the
body into a warm bath. 6. To restore breathing, put the pipe
of a common bellows in one nostril, carefully closing the other
and the mouth; at the same time drawing downward, and
pushing gently backward, the upper part of the windpipe, to
allow a more free admission of air; blow the bellows gently,
in order to inflate the lungs, till the breast be raised a little;
then set the mouth and nostrils free, and press gently on the
chest; repeat this until signs of life appear. When the patient
revives, apply smelling-salts to the nose, give warm wine
or brandy and water. <em>Cautions.</em>&mdash;1. Never rub the body
with salt or spirits. 2. Never roll the body on casks. 3.
Continue the remedies for twelve hours without ceasing.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_V" id="PART_V"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART V.</a></h2>

<h3>MISTRESS&mdash;MOTHER&mdash;NURSE&mdash;AND MAID.</h3>

<p class="hsumm"><em>In which are set forth the prominent Duties of each department,
and the most important Rules for the guidance and care of the
Household.</em></p>

<h4>OF THE TABLE</h4>

<p>814. The taste and management of the mistress are always
displayed in the general conduct of the table; for, though that
department of the household be not always under her direction,
it is always under her eye. Its management involves judgment
in expenditure, respectability of appearance, and the comfort
of her husband as well as of those who partake of their hospitality.
Inattention to it is always inexcusable, and should be
avoided for the lady's own sake, as it occasions a disagreeable
degree of bustle, and evident annoyance to herself, which is
never observable in a well-regulated establishment.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are few occasions on which the respectability
of a man is more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to
which he may accidentally bring home a visitor. Every one
ought to live according to his circumstances, and the meal of
the tradesman ought not to emulate the entertainments of the
higher classes; but, if merely two or three dishes be well served,
with the proper accompaniments, the table-linen clean, the
small sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at hand,
the expectation of both the husband and friend will be gratified,
because no interruption of the domestic arrangements will disturb
their social intercourse.</p>

<p>Should there be only a joint and a pudding, they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
always be served up separately; and the dishes, however small
the party, should always form two courses. Thus, in the old
fashioned style of "fish, soup, and a roast," the soup and fish
are placed at the top and bottom of the table, removed by the
joint with vegetables and pastry; or, should the company consist
of eight or ten, a couple or more of side-dishes in the first
course, with game and a pudding in the second, accompanied
by confectionary, are quite sufficient.</p>

<p>In most of the books which treat of cookery, various bills of
fare are given, which are never exactly followed. The mistress
should give a moderate number of those dishes which are most
in season. The cuts which are inserted in some of those lists,
put the soup in the middle of the table&mdash;where it should never
be placed. For a small party, a single lamp in the centre is
sufficient; but, for a larger number, the room should be lighted
with lamps hung over the table, and the centre occupied by a
<em>plateau</em> of glass or plate, ornamented with flowers or figures.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>815. <em>Carefulness.</em>&mdash;A proper quantity of household articles
should always be allowed for daily use. Each should also be
kept in its proper place, and applied to its proper use. Let
all repairs be done as soon as wanted, remembering the old
adage of "a stitch in time;" and never, if possible, defer any
necessary household concern a moment beyond the time when
it ought to be attended to.</p>

<p>In the purchase of glass and crockery-ware, either the most
customary patterns should be chosen, in order to secure their
being easily matched, when broken; or, if a scarce design be
adopted, an extra quantity should be bought, to guard against
the annoyance of the set being spoiled by breakage&mdash;which, in
the course of time, must be expected to happen. There should
likewise be plenty of common dishes, that the table-set may not
be used for putting away cold meat, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and cinders:
for the latter there is a new contrivance for sifting, without
dispersing the dust, by means of a covered tin bucket.</p>

<p>Small coal, wetted, makes the strongest fire for the back of
the grate, but must remain untouched till it cakes. Cinders,
lightly wetted, give a great degree of heat, and are better than
coal, for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>816. <em>Attention to little things.</em>&mdash;By attention to <em>little things</em>,
the neat appearance of a house may be secured, and time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
labor saved. For instance, when you are sewing, carefully deposit
your bits of thread, &amp;c., in a little basket or box, instead
of throwing them on the floor. And again: set your chairs
out a little from the wall, instead of putting them close to it,
which would not only rub the paint from the chairs, but would
soon deface the beauty of the wall-paper. These appear like
trifling things&mdash;but nothing is too trifling to demand our attention,
when we are endeavoring to fulfil the duties of our sphere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>817. <em>Cheerfulness.</em>&mdash;Does it seem singular that <em>cheerfulness</em>
is placed among the requisites for good house-keeping? But
it is of far more importance than you would, at first view,
imagine. What matters it to a brother or husband, if the house
be ever so neat, or the meals punctually and well prepared, if
the mistress of it is fretful and fault-finding&mdash;ever discontented
and complaining. The <em>outside</em> of such a house is ever the most
attractive to him, and any and <em>every</em> excuse will be made for
absenting himself; and the plea of business or engagements will
be made to her who is doomed to pass her hours needlessly in
solitude.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>818. <em>Of Economy in Expenditure.</em>&mdash;Economy should be the
first point in all families, whatever be their circumstances. A
prudent housekeeper will regulate the ordinary expenses of a
family, according to the annual sum allowed for housekeeping.
By this means, the provision will be uniformly good, and it will
not be requisite to practise meanness on many occasions, for
the sake of meeting extra expense on one.</p>

<p>The best check upon outrunning an income is to pay bills
weekly, for you may then retrench in time. This practice is
likewise a salutary check upon the correctness of the accounts
themselves.</p>

<p>To young beginners in housekeeping, the following brief
<em>hints on domestic economy</em>, in the management of a moderate
income, may perhaps not prove unacceptable.</p>

<p>A bill of parcels and receipt should be required, even if the
money be paid at the time of purchase; and, to avoid mistakes,
let the goods be compared with these when brought
home; or, if paid or at future periods, a bill should be sent
with the article, and regularly filed on separate files for each
tradesman.</p>

<p>An inventory of furniture, linen, and china should be kept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and the things examined by it twice a-year, or oftener if there
be a change of servants; the articles used by servants should
be intrusted to their care, with a list, as is done with the plate.
In articles not in common use, such as spare bedding, tickets of
parchment, numbered and specifying to what they belong,
should be sewed on each; and minor articles in daily use, such
as household cloths and kitchen requisites, should be occasionally
looked to.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>819. <em>Books and Accounts.</em>&mdash;Housekeeping books, with printed
forms for the various heads of expenditure, and the several articles,
are used in many families; but accounts may be kept with
as much certainty in plain books.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>820. <em>Servants.</em>&mdash;In the <em>hiring of Servants</em>, it is an excellent
plan to agree to increase their wages annually to a fixed sum,
where it should stop, and to recommend that a portion of it
should be regularly placed in a savings-bank. An incentive
will thus be offered to good conduct; and when the hoard saved
up amounts to any considerable sum, the possessor will generally
feel more inclined to enlarge than to expend it.</p>

<p>A kindly feeling of indulgence on the part of the mistress
towards her servants, in the matter of petty faults, coupled
with good-natured attention to their daily comforts, and occasional
permission to visit and receive a few of their near friends,
would go far to create a cordial degree of attachment, which
must be ever desirable to a respectable family, and cheaply
purchased by such consideration. Mildness of language will
generally be met by respectful language on the part of a servant,
and of itself will produce a saving of temper at least to
the master or mistress. Due praise will mostly be found a
powerful stimulus to good, and in some measure a preventive
to bad conduct, on the part of a servant.</p>

<p>Do not speak harshly or imperatively to servants, or tell
them of their faults in the presence of strangers or visitors; but
take the earliest opportunity of reproving them after your company
have left.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>821. <em>Store-room.</em>&mdash;A store-room is essential for the custody
of articles in constant use, as well as for others which are only
occasionally called for. These should be at hand when wanted,
each in separate drawers, or on shelves and pegs, all under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
lock and key of the mistress, and never be given out to the servants
but under her inspection.</p>

<p>Pickles and preserves, prepared and purchased sauces, and
all sorts of groceries, should be there stored; the spices pounded
and corked up in small bottles, sugar broken, and everything
in readiness for use. Lemon-peel, thyme, parsley, and all sorts
of sweet herbs, should be dried and grated for use in seasons of
plenty; the tops of tongues saved, and dried, for grating into
omelets, &amp;c.; and care taken that nothing be wasted that can
be turned to good account.</p>

<p>Coarse nets suspended in the store-room are very useful in
preserving the finer kinds of fruit, lemons, &amp;c., which are
spoiled if allowed to touch. When <em>lemons</em> and <em>oranges</em> are
cheap, a proper quantity should be bought and prepared, both
for preserving the juice, and keeping the peel for sweetmeats
and grating, especially by those who live in the country, where
they cannot always be had; and they are perpetually wanted
in cookery.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>822. <em>Sugar.</em>&mdash;The lowest-priced and coarsest sugar is not the
cheapest in the end, as it is heavy, dirty, and of a very inferior
degree of sweetness; that which is most refined is the sweetest:
the best has a bright and gravelly appearance. East India
sugars appear finer in proportion to the price; but they do not
contain so much sweetness as the other kinds. Loaf-sugars
should be chosen as fine and as close in texture as possible, except
they are for preserving, when the coarse, strong, open kind
is preferable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>823. <em>Pepper.</em>&mdash;The finest Cayenne pepper consists of powdered
bird-pepper; but, as this is of a bad color, it is often
adulterated to heighten the color. English chilies, dried and
pounded, make good pepper.</p>

<p>White pepper is inferior to black, although the former is
sold at the highest price. White pepper is merely black pepper
deprived of its outer coating, which has a stimulating
property; so that white pepper is much weaker than black.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>824. <em>Cinnamon</em>, when good, is rather thin and pliable, and
about the substance of thick paper, of yellowish-brown color,
sweetish taste, and pleasant odor: that which is hard, thick,
and dark-colored, should be rejected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>825. <em>Articles in Season.</em>&mdash;Some weak-minded persons affect
to despise articles of food when they are plentiful and cheap,
not knowing that such is the time when the articles are in the
greatest perfection.</p>

<p>Young and inexperienced housekeepers sometimes incur unnecessary
expense by ordering articles of food when they are
scarce, dear, and hardly come into season. This can only be
prevented by attention to the seasons of different articles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>826. <em>Every Family to make their own Sweet Oil.</em>&mdash;With a
small hand-mill, every family might make their own sweet oil.
This may easily be done, by grinding or beating the seeds of
white poppies into a paste, then boil it in water, and skim off
the oil as it rises; one bushel of seed weighs fifty pounds, and
produces two gallons of oil. Of the sweet olive oil sold, one-half
is oil of poppies. The poppies will grow in any garden;
it is the large-head white poppy, sold by apothecaries. Large
fields are sown with poppies in France and Flanders, for the
purpose of expressing oil from their seed for food. When the
seed is taken out, the poppy head when dried is boiled to an
extract, which is sold at two shillings per ounce, and it is to be
preferred to opium, which now sells very high. Large fortunes
may be acquired by the cultivation of poppies. Women and
children could attend to the cultivation of any quantity required
for their own use, in making oil, and it would be found
a profitable branch of industry, when engaged in on a large
scale.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>827. <em>Candles and Lamps.</em>&mdash;In purchasing wax, spermaceti,
or composition candles for <em>company</em>, there will be a saving by
proportioning the length and size of the lights to the probable
duration of the party. Mixed wax and spermaceti make the
best candles, of which a long <em>four</em> (that is, four to the pound,)
will last ten hours; a short <em>six</em> will burn six hours; a <em>three</em>,
twelve hours.</p>

<p>A moderate-sized French table-lamp, will consume a quarter
of a pint of oil in twelve hours and a half.</p>

<p>A common japanned kitchen-lamp, with one burner, will
consume one-eighth of a pint of oil in nine hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>828. <em>Neats'-foot Oil.</em>&mdash;Boil the feet for several hours, as for
making stock for jelly; skim off the oily matter from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
time as it rises, and, when it ceases to come up, pour off the
water; next day, take off the cake of fat and oil which will be
found on the top; boil it and the oil before obtained, together
with a little cold water; let it cool; pour off the water, and
bottle the oil for use. This oil being perfectly pure, and free
from smell, may be used with the French lights in a sick-room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>829. <em>Soap.</em>&mdash;Soap, as well as candles, is improved by keeping.
Buy your store for the winter as early as September,
and cut the large bars of soap into pieces, to dry. It goes farther,
and is better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>830. <em>Coals.</em>&mdash;Lay in your stock of coal and wood, during
summer, when fuel of all kinds is cheapest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>831. <em>Good method of making Fires.</em>&mdash;In managing your fires
during the day, first lay on a shovelful of the dust and ashes
from under the grate, then a few coals, then more ashes, and
afterwards a few more coals, and thus proceed till your grate
is properly filled, placing a few round coals in front. You will
find that the ashes retain the heat better than coals alone; you
will have less smoke, a pleasant fire, and a very little waste
left at night.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>832. <em>Kitchen-Paper.</em>&mdash;Whited-brown and common writing
is much used: it should be bought by the ream or half-ream,
which will be much cheaper than by the quire. White paper
only should be used for singeing, and for covering meat, pastry,
&amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>833. <em>Economy in Tinder.</em>&mdash;The very high price of paper, at
present, renders the saving of even the smallest quantity of
linen or cotton rags of consequence, as they sell very dear.
Trifling as it may be thought, yet it will be found that a considerable
quantity of rags may be saved in a family, by using
as tinder for lighting matches, the contents of the common
snuffers, collected in the course of the evening.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>834. <em>To prevent Accidents, from leaving a poker in the fire.</em>&mdash;The
following invention is equally simple and secure:&mdash;Immediately
above that square part of the poker, by blacksmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
called "the bit," let a small cross of iron, about an inch and a
half each way, be welded in.</p>

<p>The good consequences of this simple contrivance will be&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. If the poker, by the fire giving way, should slip out, it
will probably catch on the edge of the fender.</p>

<p>2d. If it should not, it cannot injure the hearth or carpet, as
the hot part of the poker will be borne up some inches.</p>

<p>3d. The poker cannot be run into the fire further than the
bit, which, in regard to a polished poker, is also of some consequence.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS, YOUNG CHILDREN, AND THE SICK.</h4>

<p>835. In a previous work&mdash;"Mrs. Hale's New Cook Book,"&mdash;I
gave many receipts for preparing food for invalids and
children; but something more is needed. Young mothers
and nurses, who are often inexperienced, will, I am sure, thank
me for taking pains to procure, from the most eminent authorities,
the best directions and recipes to aid them in the discharge
of their arduous and most important duties. The preservation
of life, and the formation of the physical constitution, as well
as the moral development of the young beings committed by
Divine Providence to the especial care of woman, render it
one of the best accomplishments of our sex, to learn all we can
respecting the high vocation whereunto we are called, viz., that
of conservators of humanity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>836. <em>Of young Infants.</em>&mdash;Immediately on the birth of the
child, it should be received into soft fine flannel, sufficient completely
to envelop or wrap round the body, in which, with the
mouth and nose scarcely exposed, it should repose at least an
hour. The child may then be washed with <em>tepid</em> water, tenderly
and cautiously, yet speedily made dry with soft linen cloth.
Afterwards let it be expeditiously dressed, and put into a warm,
bed, and, during the first week or fortnight, exposed as little
as possible to cold air: how long this caution may be necessary,
will depend on the season of the year, or the temperature of
the atmosphere. By strictly adhering to this mode of managing
a new-born infant, it will not suffer from catarrh, cough,
difficulty of breathing, diarrhea, sore eyes, or stoppage in the
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Children are frequently placed under the care of a nurse,
who, from her experience, is supposed qualified for the important
trust; but it often happens, either from her obstinacy or
self-importance, that the most judicious plan of treatment recommended
by the attending physician, is defeated.</p>

<p>At this period the mother is called on, by religious and
moral obligation, as well as by the ties of natural affection, to
suckle her infant: no doubt could be entertained of her immediate
assent to so powerful an impulse, if uninfluenced by her
friends or relatives. It cannot be denied, that she may be disqualified
for the office by various maladies, by an incipient
phthisis, by a scorbutic or scrofulous taint, by hysterical or
nervous affections, &amp;c. However, the fitness or unfitness of
the mother for this endearing office, should be determined by
the attending physician. There are many instances recorded of
women who had been extremely delicate and sickly previous to
their first confinement, becoming afterwards healthy and robust.
On the contrary, there are several histories of other women,
who previously had enjoyed good health, suffering from counteracting
the regular process of nature. The flow of the milk
being checked, undue determinations have taken place to the
chest or head, and in some cases proved fatal.</p>

<p>In the bowels of children at the time of their birth, there is
an accumulation of what is called "the meconium." For whatever
purpose it was intended before the birth of the child, it
would become injurious were it afterwards suffered to remain.
Nature has provided the means for its removal, by giving to
the new milk an aperient quality. Therefore it is advisable to
wait, even to the third day, for the appearance of the milk,
rather than attempt to remove the meconium by castor oil, or
any other mild aperient medicine. The coats of the child's
stomach and bowels are so extremely tender and irritable, that
the mildest purgative will give pain, and disorder the health
of the infant. By waiting for the milk, relief is obtained by
the means nature has provided, without the slightest inconvenience.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>837. <em>Clothing.</em>&mdash;The clothing for children cannot be too simple:
it should be so formed as to admit of being easily and
quickly changed, free from all bandages or pins, and secured
only by tape. Shoes or stockings may be dispensed with, until
the child begins to use its legs, as they keep the feet wet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
unpleasant, unless changed every hour. The child left to itself,
will soon begin to enjoy the use and freedom of its limbs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>838. <em>Food.</em>&mdash;The proper food for children is a subject of
more importance. That which nature has provided is the milk
of its parent; but, when this is lacking, a preparation formed
of cow's milk and water, with a little loaf sugar, in the following
proportions, supplies the desideratum:&mdash;Take of fresh
cow's milk, one table-spoonful; hot water, two table-spoonfuls;
loaf sugar, as much as may be agreeable. Such nourishment
will alone be sufficient for its support, until the end of the first
three months. At this period, it may require a small portion
of light animal food, of which, how to select the most nutritious,
to regulate the quantity, and to administer it, after proper intervals,
must depend on the experience of the nurse. Experience
is often superseded by convenience: if the child cries, the nurse
attributes it to a want of food, and, by her agency, it is fed
almost every hour, both night and day. It is seldom that a
child cries from abstinence, if it be healthy and free from pain.
In the infantile state, the powers of the digestive organs are
much weaker than at a more advanced period of life; and therefore,
although the food is more simple, it requires an interval
of some hours to convert it into chyle: if this process be interrupted
by frequent feeding, the chyle will be crude, and pass
off without affording due nourishment to the child. Sickness
in children arises from the quality or quantity of their food, unduly
administered. The food for children should be light and
simple&mdash;gruel alone, or mixed with cow's milk; mutton broth,
or beef tea; stale bread, rusks, or biscuits, boiled in water to
a proper consistence, and a little sugar added. The great mortality
of children in large towns, may be attributed to the
poverty of their parents, who cannot purchase the necessary
food or clothing, nor find leisure to attend to cleanliness, air,
and exercise, so indispensably necessary to the well-being of
their offspring. In the wealthy ranks of society, these means
are easily obtained; and in the management of their children,
we have only to dread the abuse of these advantages. Happy
would it be both for rich and poor, if the superfluities of the one
could be transferred for the benefit of the other.</p>

<p>When six months old, a child may be fed every four hours,
when awake. Nothing can be more injurious to health than
too frequent or irregular meals. Children, if left to themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
soon acquire the habit of passing through the night without
being fed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>839. <em>Weaning</em> of children should not take place under six
months, if the mother be in health, nor be deferred beyond nine
months. It cannot be too frequently impressed on the mind
of the parent, that the future health and strength of her child
depend on a due supply of the food which nature has provided.
Regarding her own health, the chances are that it will be improved&mdash;at
all events, it is incumbent on her to make the experiment;
if her strength falls off, she may at any time retire
from the effort, and engage a wet-nurse.</p>

<p>This <em>foster-parent</em> should not be more than thirty years of
age, nor should her milk be more than three months old. She
should be in health, free from scorbutic or scrofulous taints,
from cutaneous scurf, or eruptions, perfectly clean in her person,
and extremely neat in her management of whatever concerns
the child. She must be sober and temperate: her diet
should consist of a due proportion of bread, fresh meat, and
vegetables; her drink, tea, chocolate, and milk and water;
but on no consideration either wine or any other spirituous
liquors. These, if drank by the nurse, will prove injurious to
the child.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>840. <em>Proper Medicines for Infants.</em>&mdash;Nature has not only
provided food for infants, but likewise given to them a constitution
capable of correcting those slight deviations from health,
to which alone they are liable when properly nursed. This
has induced many to assert that medicines are not required in
the nursery: perhaps the assertion might be correct, if children
were suffered to remain in a state of nature: the further they
are removed from it, the evils they have to contend with bear
a proportionate increase. As most of their complaints arise
from a want of attention to their food, to air, and exercise, by
a prompt and skilful use of medicine, these complaints may be
removed; therefore, it is not the use but the abuse of medicine
that should be avoided. If a child be tormented by a pin running
into the flesh, no one would contend against the removal
of the pin.</p>

<p>The diseases to which children are liable, are sore eyes, sore
ears, sore head, scald head, sickness and vomiting, thrush, red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
gum, yellow gum, pain in the bowels, diarrhea, dentition, chilblains,
rickets, worms, scrofula, catarrh, cough, measles, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>841. <em>Sore Eyes</em> frequently occur on the second or third day
after the birth, occasioned by too early an exposure of the child
to a cold atmosphere: the eyelids swell, become closed, and
discharge a purulent matter. It may be relieved by fomenting
the eyelids with equal parts of lime water and elder-flower
water. Dip some fine old linen cloth into this mixture, moderately
warmed, and apply it to the eyelids. This is a mild
astringent application: if the swellings should not be reduced
by it, the following, which is more astringent, will probably
succeed: Take of white vitriol, two grains; rose-water, two
ounces; mix them together. Should it be necessary, the quantity
of white vitriol may be increased.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>842. <em>Sore Ears.</em>&mdash;Excoriations of the skin frequently happen
either behind the ears, in the folds of the skin, on the neck, in
the groins, or wherever the folds of the skin, come in contact.
Wash the skin morning and evening with cold water, make it
perfectly dry with a fine linen cloth, then shake on lightly the
following powder: Take white ceruse, one part; wheaten
starch, in flour, three parts; mix them together. Or, take
Goulard's extract, French brandy, of each, one drachm; rose-water,
four ounces. Mix them together, and apply it with soft
linen cloth to the excoriations of the skin.</p>

<p>The following liniment may be relied on: Take acetate of
lead, one scruple; rose-water, half an ounce; melted beef marrow,
one ounce. Rub the acetate of lead in the rose-water, until
they are intimately mixed, then melt the marrow over a gentle
heat; afterwards pour the mixture upon the marrow by little
and little, taking care that each addition be incorporated with
the marrow, so as to form an uniform mass. This may be applied
with a camels'-hair pencil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>843. <em>Sore Head.</em>&mdash;This complaint appears first on the forehead,
in large white spots or scabs, which, if neglected, soon
spread over the whole surface of the head. It is sometimes
dry, at others moist, with a thin, watery discharge. It is named
the crusta lactea, or milky crust. There are two methods of
treating it. Nurses encourage the discharge by applying cabbage
leaves, oil-cloth, &amp;c.; this is by no means necessary; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
makes the head offensive, and the appearance of the child disgusting.
It is much better to cure it as soon as possible, by
washing the scabs night and morning with equal parts of brandy
and water; then lay on the following ointment: Take, olive
oil, five drachms; white wax, two drachms; calcined zinc, one
drachm. Melt the oil and wax together, then add the zinc by
degrees, and keep stirring it until they are intimately mixed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>844. <em>Scald Head</em> is totally unlike the preceding disease:
brown-colored scabs appear on the crown of the head, which discharge
a glutinous matter, and unite the hairs, so as to prevent
their being separated with a comb: these scabs continue to
spread until they occupy the whole of the scalp.</p>

<p>Keep the hair cut as close as possible, wash the head with a
strong solution of soap in water, night and morning; as soon as
it can be done, instead of cutting the hair with scissors, let it be
shaved close once a day.</p>

<p>Every one has a remedy for this complaint; perhaps the following
ointment will be found one of the most effective: Take
Barbadoes tar, one ounce; the dust of the lycoperdon, or puff
fungus, one drachm. Mix them well together, and rub in a
part of it to the roots of the hair, after washing the head with
the soap and water. By steadily persevering in these means,
and giving an occasional purge, the cure will soon be accomplished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>845. <em>Sickness and Vomiting.</em>&mdash;Soon after the birth, children
are frequently annoyed by these symptoms: they are occasioned
by the indiscreet conduct of the nurses, who are apt to
give either improper food or medicine. At this early period,
as before remarked, the stomach is incapable of digesting any
other food than the milk of its mother; consequently, whatever
is forced into it, remains there undigested, until, by a convulsive
effort, it is thrown off by vomiting. So long as it remains
in the stomach, the child is restless, and in other respects
indisposed. It may be relieved by a tea-spoonful of castor-oil,
to be repeated, until one or two motions are occasioned.</p>

<p>Children who are dry nursed are most subject to sickness
and vomiting; the natural remedy is the breast of a healthy
woman. Without this relief, gripings and diarrhea frequently
come on and prove fatal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Children so circumstanced, may be relieved by the following
emetic:</p>

<p>Take of ipecacuanha, two drachms; boiling water, four
ounces. Let them stand together until the water grows cold,
then strain off the liquor. To one ounce of the liquor, add
eight drops of antimonial wine. Dose, two tea-spoonfuls every
half hour, until it excites vomiting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>846. <em>The Thrush</em>, or sore mouth, is a complaint very painful,
and, if neglected, fatal to children. When it first comes on,
it resembles small pieces of curd lying loose upon the tongue;
it gradually spreads itself over the inside of the mouth, but afterwards
rapidly advances to the throat, stomach, and bowels.
Therefore, when the white specks appear, proper means should
be instantly employed to remove them, or to suspend their
progress. If the child be costive, give the following aperient:</p>

<p>Take of calcined magnesia, two scruples; common mint
water, two ounces; mix them together. The dose, a dessert-spoonful
every half hour, until it operates. Or, take of manna,
one ounce; senna leaves, one drachm; common mint-water,
four ounces. Boil them together, until the manna be dissolved,
then strain off the liquor. Dose, two drachms every half hour,
until two or more motions are occasioned.</p>

<p>For cleaning the mouth, take equal parts of borax and white
sugar; rub them together into a fine powder. Of this put a
small quantity into the child's mouth, which will be distributed
to every part by the motion of its tongue. Repeat this application
three or four times a day: if used early, it will keep the
mouth free from white specks, and remove the complaint in
a few days.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, it should be neglected, and suffered to
extend to the stomach and bowels, gentle emetics ought to be
employed, such as the following antimonial emetic: Take of
antimonial wine, forty drops; mint-water, two ounces. Mix
them together. Dose, a dessert-spoonful every half hour, until
it excites vomiting.</p>

<p>This disease rarely occurs in children, who take no other food
but the milk of the mother, or foster-parent. It is so far contagious,
that if a healthy child be put to the breast of a woman,
who is suckling another child, having the thrush, it will contract
this complaint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>847. <em>Red Gum</em> requires no farther attention than keeping the
bowels gently open, and avoiding an exposure to cold air. It
is symptomatic of healthy action, and ought not to be checked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>848. <em>Infantile Jaundice.</em>&mdash;The skin of new-born infants is
sometimes tinged with bile, and gives the appearance of jaundice;
by some it has been named the yellow gum. It seems
to be occasioned by the sudden change in the circulation of the
blood, immediately on the birth, by which an increased flow of
blood is conveyed to the liver, and consequently an increased
secretion of bile follows, which from various causes may be
prevented from passing off freely into the intestines. It is attended
with no danger, and is generally removed by mild purgatives.</p>

<p>The hare-lip, frænum linguæ, or tongue-tied, requires surgical
aid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>849. <em>Pain in the Bowels</em> may happen with or without diarrhea,
and is often produced by improper food, or exposure to
cold air. The symptoms are frequent fits of crying, drawing
up the knees towards the bowels, which are hard and tense to
the touch, accompanied either with an obstinate costiveness, or
thin, watery, and frequent evacuations, slimy, sour, and of a
green color. This complaint is oftentimes relieved by the following
powders: Take Turkey rhubarb, in very fine powder,
calcined magnesia, of each, twelve grains; compound powder
of ipecacuanha, four grains. Mix them well together, and divide
them into six doses: one to be given night and morning,
to a child under three months; above that age, the dose should
be increased.</p>

<p>The health and diet of the mother, or nurse, should be strictly
attended to. In some cases the pain is extremely acute, and
the agony of the child is known by its cries. Whenever this
happens, the following mixture may be given: Take of Turkey
rhubarb, in fine powder, twelve grains; magnesia, eight grains;
tincture of rhubarb, one drachm; syrup of poppies, two
drachms; simple mint-water, an ounce and a half. Mix them
together. Dose, if within the first or second month, two tea-spoonfuls
every fourth hour. The phial should be shaken before
the medicine is poured out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>850. <em>Other remedies for the Colic in Infants.</em>&mdash;A great variety
of cordials, spices, and opiates, has been recommended, and
frequently used, to relieve the pain and expel the wind. They
may sometimes answer the purpose, especially in sudden fits
of pain in the stomach, from cold or any other accidental cause.
At all times, they should be sufficiently diluted with water,
cautiously given, and seldom repeated. When the effects of
these medicines go off, the pain returns; therefore it is not a
desirable mode of obtaining relief. Of the cordials, Geneva,
mixed with water, is the least objectionable; being impregnated
with the essential oil of juniper-berries, it is an excellent and
safe carminative. However, these warm medicines are by no
means to be relied on for the removal of the cause of this
malady, their effect being merely temporary: such as Godfrey's
cordial, and other nostrums&mdash;being compounds of opium, spices,
and brandy. Opium, when judiciously administered, is
an invaluable remedy; the dose of it should be most accurately
proportioned to the age of the patient, and urgency of the symptoms,
otherwise it may become a <em>poison</em>; and, therefore, should
never be given to children, unless under the direction of the
most skilful in the profession. Few nurseries are without a
medicine of this kind; it quiets the pain of the infant, induces
sleep, and leaves the nurse to her repose. Children under this
treatment become languid, pallid, incapable of exertion, and, at
length, rickety.</p>

<p>The following anodyne mixture will generally relieve the
griping pains of diarrhea:&mdash;Take of prepared chalk, and gum-arabic,
each one drachm; syrup of white poppies, three drachms;
Geneva, two drachms; water, four ounces. Mix them together.
Dose, a dessert-spoonful after each motion.</p>

<p>In bowel-complaints, chalk has been objected to, as too powerful
an astringent in checking diarrhea suddenly: this may be
obviated by giving it only after each motion. When the bowels
have been previously acted on, either by the rhubarb powders,
or by the antimonial emetic, the chalk mixture is a never-failing
remedy. It may be given with or without opium, according
to the urgency of the symptoms.</p>

<p>The following medicine, by exciting a determination to the
skin, effectually relieves the sufferings of the child:&mdash;Take ipecacuanha,
in coarse powder, two drachms; boiling water, four
ounces. When cold, strain off the liquor through a fine piece
of linen cloth: then add to three ounces of this liquor&mdash;of Geneva,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
three drachms; syrup of white poppies, two drachms.
Dose, a dessert-spoonful every fourth hour.</p>

<p>When this state of the bowels is followed by convulsions,
the lower extremities, or the whole body, should be immersed
in a warm bath. During the preparation of a bath, flannel
dipped in warm water and wrung dry, may be applied to the
extremities. Leeches and blisters, under skilful directions, will
subdue the violence of the symptoms.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>851. <em>Convulsions</em>&mdash;Are generally symptomatic, and, for the
most part, in children, occasioned by the growth of their teeth:
therefore, the gums should be carefully examined, to ascertain
whether they arise from this cause; if so, the lancet should be
immediately and freely used, to divide the gum down to the
teeth. This operation is not painful, nor in the least degree
hazardous, therefore ought not to be delayed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>852. <em>Dentition.</em>&mdash;There is no period in infancy that requires
more skill and attention, than that which passes from the first
movement of the teeth in their sockets, to their subsequent advance
through the gums. At the birth of the child, the teeth
are lodged within the jaw-bones, and enveloped by a membrane
or bag, which is distended as the teeth enlarge and press forward,
frequently attended with pain, fever, diarrhea, and convulsions.
These symptoms first appear towards the end of
the third month, when the child is said to be breeding its teeth:
they arise from the first enlargement of the teeth in their sockets,
and subside as soon as they pass above the jaw. Between
the sixth and ninth month, the teeth as they rise, press upon
the gums, when the same train of symptoms take place. Some
children suffer very little pain during this process; others suffer
most severely: this depends chiefly on the nerves being more
or less irritable. When the child preserves its appetite and
cheerfulness, and is free from fever, no medicine can be required,
except what may be necessary to obviate costiveness.
This should be carefully attended to, as nothing tends more
effectually to relieve or prevent the symptoms of dentition,
than a free discharge from the bowels.</p>

<p>An increased secretion of saliva marks the first advance of
the teeth, followed, in irritable habits, by diarrhea, fever, thirst,
and convulsions. The use of the gum-lancet should not be
neglected, whenever the symptoms are urgent. The parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
frequently object to this mode of relief, conceiving it to be a
painful operation. As a proof of the contrary, children that
have once been relieved by it, will eagerly press their gums
upon the lancet. If the tooth should not appear after the first
use of the lancet, the incision may be frequently repeated.</p>

<p>The symptoms may be relieved by the following emetic:&mdash;Take
of tartar-emetic, one grain; dissolve it in two ounces of
distilled water. Dose, two tea-spoonfuls every half-hour, until
it excites vomiting.</p>

<p>This remedy will relax the tension of the gums, and lessen
the force of the fever.</p>

<p>If the habit of the child should be costive, the mildest purgatives
should be employed, to occasion two or more motions
daily&mdash;such as manna, dissolved in common mint-water; or
senna-tea; or the following:&mdash;Take of senna leaves, one drachm;
the yellow rind of the lemon, eight grains: boil them in two
ounces of water; strain off the liquor, when cold; and give a
dessert-spoonful as a dose for children three or four months old.
Or, take manna and fresh-drawn oil of sweet almonds, of each,
one ounce; syrup of roses, two ounces: mix them together.
Dose, a dessert-spoonful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>853. <em>The Croup</em>&mdash;At its commencement has the appearance
of common catarrh, but speedily assumes its peculiar character,
which is marked by hoarseness, with a shrillness and ringing
sound in coughing and breathing; so shrill is the noise made by
the child, that it resembles the sound of air forced through a tube
of brass. This inflammation, seated in the membrane which
lines the windpipe, is attended with stricture, difficult respiration,
cough, quick pulse, heat, and a flushed countenance.</p>

<p>This disease comes on suddenly, and is extremely rapid in
its progress; therefore, vigorous measures must be instantly
adopted. Give an emetic, then apply a blister across the throat,
and keep the bowels open with laxative injections.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>854. <em>Cure for Croup.</em>&mdash;Dr. Fisher, of Boston, relates in a late
number of the Medical <cite>Journal</cite>, a case in which a severe attack
of croup was cured by the application of sponge, wrung out of
hot water, to the throat, together with water treatment, which
he describes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Soon after making the first application of sponges to the
throat, I wrapped the child in a <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'wollen'">woolen</span> blanket, wrung out in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
warm water, as a substitute for a warm bath, and gave twenty
drops of the wine of antimony in a little sweetened water, which
was swallowed with difficulty. I persevered in the application
of the hot, moist sponges for an hour, when the child was so
much relieved that I ventured to leave it.</p>

<p>"These applications were continued through the night, and in
the morning the child was well."</p>

<p>It will never do to trifle with this terrible disease. The quicker
the remedies are applied, the better. Instead of antimony, we
would recommend small quantities of alum water, given every
ten or fifteen minutes, until the child vomits.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>855. <em>Rickets</em>&mdash;Are, for the most part, induced by improper food
and bad nursing. Their approach is marked by a sickly, pallid
countenance, cough, and difficult respiration. The bones of the
legs and arms lose their firmness, and become more or less
crooked; the bones of the head do not unite, and the spine becomes
distorted. At its first appearance it may be successfully
counteracted by a strict attention to cleanliness in every thing
that concerns the child, by exercise in the open air, by cold
bathing, by friction of the limbs night and morning, and by a
light, nutritious diet. Before the use of the bath, the bowels
should be cleared by the following aperient powder:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of Rhubarb, in fine powder, six grains; calcined magnesia,
three grains; common mint-water, six drachms. Mix them
together.</p>

<p>During the use of the cold bath, either Peruvian bark or steel
may be employed to strengthen the child: such as,</p>

<p>The precipitate of the sulphate of iron, three grains; syrup
of cinnamon, a tea-spoonful. When mixed, to be taken three
times a-day. Or, take of the resinous extract of bark, one
drachm; the syrup of cinnamon, seven drachms. Mix them
together. The dose, a tea-spoonful, three times a-day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>856. <em>Scrofula.</em>&mdash;Although it has been considered as an hereditary
disease, may be induced in a child, whose parents have
no such taint, by a neglect of proper food, air and exercise.
On the contrary, when the taint does exist in the parent, the
offspring may pass through life with the enjoyment of tolerable
health, by a strict attention to those means which are known to
invigorate the body. Of preventives, there are none so efficacious
as sea air, sea bathing, and the internal use of the sea water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in sufficient quantity to act on the bowels, and the local application
of it to the glands which are enlarged. Indeed, the
children of diseased parents should reside on the coast, in order
to have the full benefit of these advantages. Friction should
be applied generally on the surface of the body, with the hand
covered with a flannel glove, night and morning. Food of easy
digestion is to be preferred, such as shell-fish, game, poultry,
beef or mutton. Bark and steel, as medicines, may be occasionally
administered with good effect. This disease, which bids
defiance to the regular physician, cannot with propriety be
placed on the list of casualties, or sudden seizures.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>857. <em>Worms.</em>&mdash;There are three species of worms which infest
the intestines: namely, the flat worm, or tænia; the long,
round worm, lumbrici; the short, round worm, or ascarides.
The tænia is of rare occurrence when compared with the lumbrici
or ascarides, but more difficult to remove. Full doses of
sulphate of iron, with occasional active doses of calomel, force
them to retire. The lumbrici are destroyed by repeated doses
of calomel and scammony. The ascarides, being found in the
lowest portion of the intestines, are easily removed by injections
of lime-water, or a solution of aloes.</p>

<p>Parents who would preserve their children from worms, ought
to allow them plenty of exercise in the open air; to take care
that their food be wholesome and sufficiently solid; and, as far
as possible, to prevent their eating raw herbs, roots, or green
trashy fruits. It will not be amiss to allow a child who is subject
to worms, a glass of red wine after meals; as every thing that
braces and strengthens the stomach, is good both for preventing
and expelling these vermin. In order to prevent any mistake
of what I have here said in favor of <em>solid</em> food, it may be proper
to observe, that I only made use of that word in opposition to
<em>slops</em> of every kind; not to advise parents to cram their children
with meat, two or three times a-day. This should only be
allowed at dinner, and in moderate quantities, or it would create,
instead of preventing, worms; for there is no substance in
nature which generates so many worms as the flesh of animals,
when in a state of putrefaction. Meat, therefore, at the principal
meal, should always be accompanied with plenty of good
bread, and young, tender, and well-boiled vegetables; especially
in the spring, when these are poured forth from the bosom of
the earth in such profusion. They promote the end in view, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
keeping the body moderately open, without the aid of artificial
physic. The ripe fruits of autumn produce the same effect;
and, from their cooling, antiputrescent qualities, are as wholesome
as the unripe are pernicious. I also very earnestly conjure
parents not to take the alarm at every imaginary symptom
of worms, and directly run for drugs to the quack, or apothecary.
They should first try the good effects of proper diet and
regimen, and never have recourse to medicines till after unequivocal
proofs of the nature of the complaint.</p>

<p>Honey and milk are very good for worms; so is strong salt
water; likewise, powdered sage and molasses taken freely.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>858. <em>Quinsy</em>&mdash;Is the common inflammatory sore throat,
attended by a sense of heat and fulness in the throat, by difficult
deglutition, generally preceded by shivering, with a sense
of coldness. On inspection, the tonsils appear red and enlarged.
These symptoms continuing to increase, the patient is threatened
with suffocation, the tonsils suppurate, when, by a spontaneous
bursting of the abscess, relief instantly follows. It often happens
that the abscess does not give way so soon as expected,
when the puncture of a lancet puts an end to the alarming sufferings
of the patient. In some cases, the quantity of matter
contained in the tumor is very considerable, and instances have
occurred, when, from the sudden bursting of the tumor, the
patient being in a horizontal position, suffocation has followed,
from the matter falling into the lungs.</p>

<p>To guard against these evils, an emetic of ipecacuanha should
be administered, and a blister applied to the neck. As soon
as the effect of the emetic has ceased, and the stomach will
receive it, give the following aperient mixture:&mdash;Take of tartarized
kali, three drachms; infusion of senna, two ounces;
tincture of senna, two drachms. Mix them together.</p>

<p>If blisters are objected to, a piece of fine flannel, moistened
with the compound spirit of ammonia, may be placed round
the neck. Gargles are to be used in every stage of this disease;
at first, they should be mildly detergent, as the following:&mdash;Take
of barley-water, six ounces and a half; honey of roses,
one ounce; tincture of myrrh, and vinegar, of each, two drachms.
Mix them together, and cleanse the mouth and throat with
some of the gargle from time to time.</p>

<p>When the violence of the symptoms begins to subside, a
sharper gargle becomes necessary; for this purpose the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
is recommended:&mdash;Take of infusion of red roses, seven
ounces; honey of roses, one ounce; diluted sulphuric acid,
twenty drops. Mix them together.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of this disease, keep the bowels open
with mild purgatives or laxative injections. When the swelling
of the tonsils comes on rapidly, send instantly for a surgeon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>859. <em>Whooping Cough.</em>&mdash;This is a violent, convulsive cough,
attended at first with slight febrile symptoms. Its shortest
duration is three weeks; during this time, the symptoms may
be rendered milder, or more aggravated, by the mode of treatment.</p>

<p>During the first three or four weeks, keep the child or patient
in an uniform degree of temperature; if possible, never below
64 degrees of Fahrenheit's scale. The diet should be light,
chiefly bread, milk, and vegetables with butter. Rice or Indian
puddings, with plenty of molasses, are good food for children
in this disease. If the cough is very violent, and the phlegm
hard in the throat, a gentle emetic of ipecacuanha, or some preparation
of antimony, should be given every second or third
morning, to clear the stomach from the mucus which, in this
cough, is constantly secreted. By these means, the violence
of the disease will soon be overcome; whereas, by an exposure
to cold air, and neglecting all precautions, you may aggravate and
continue the cough for months. In the summer, change of air
is one of the best remedies; and be sure to avoid whatever has
a tendency to irritate the throat, or excite the action of the
heart. In this, as in every other disease, the state of the bowels
should be carefully attended to. A mild aperient is sometimes
necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>860. <em>Colds.</em>&mdash;The best <em>preventive</em> of colds, is to wash your
children every day thoroughly in cold water, if they are strong
enough to bear it; if not, add a little warm water, and rub the
skin dry. This keeps the pores open. If they do take cold,
give them a warm bath as soon as possible; if that is not convenient,
bathe the feet and hands, and wash the body all over
in warm water; then give a cup of warm tea, and cover the
patient in bed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>861.&mdash;If a <em>Sore Throat</em> follow, take a tumbler of molasses
and water, half-and-half, when going to bed; and rub the throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
with a mixture of sweet or goose-oil and spirits of turpentine;
then wear flannel round it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>862. <em>Canker, or Sore Month.</em>&mdash;Steep blackberry-leaves, sweeten
with honey, sprinkle in a little burnt alum, and wash the
mouth often with this decoction.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>863. <em>Cutaneous Eruptions in Children.</em>&mdash;Children, while on
the breast, are seldom free from eruptions of one kind or other.
These, however, are not often dangerous, and ought never to
be dried up but with the greatest caution. They tend to free
the bodies of infants from hurtful humors, which, if retained,
might produce fatal disorders. The eruptions of children are
chiefly owing to improper food and neglect of cleanliness. If a
child be stuffed at all hours with food that its stomach is not
able to digest, such food not being properly assimilated, instead
of nourishing the body, fills it with gross humors. These must
either break out in form of eruptions upon the skin, or remain
in the body, and occasion fevers and other internal disorders.</p>

<p>Eruptions are the effect of improper food, or want of cleanliness:
a proper attention to these alone will generally be sufficient
to remove them. If this should not be the case, some
drying medicines will be necessary. When they are applied,
the body ought at the same time to be kept open, and cold is
carefully to be avoided. We know no medicine that is more
safe for drying up cutaneous eruptions than sulphur, provided
it be prudently used. A little of the flour of sulphur may be
mixed with fresh butter, oil, or hog's lard, and the parts affected
frequently touched with it.</p>

<p>The most obstinate of all the eruptions incident to children
are, the <em>tinea capitis</em>, or scabbed head, and chilblains. The
scabbed head is often exceedingly difficult to cure, and sometimes,
indeed, the cure proves worse than the disease. I have
frequently known children seized with internal disorders, of
which they died soon after their scabbed heads had been healed
by the application of drying medicines. The cure ought always
first to be attempted by keeping the head very clean, cutting
off the hair, combing and brushing away the scabs, &amp;c. If this
is not sufficient, let the head be shaved once a-week, washed
daily with yellow soap, and gently anointed with a liniment
made of train-oil, eight ounces, red precipitate, in fine powder,
one drachm. And if there be proud flesh, it should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
touched with a bit of blue vitriol, or sprinkled with a little burnt
alum. While these things are doing, the patient must be confined
to a regular light diet, the body should be kept gently
open, and cold, as far as possible, ought to be avoided. To
prevent any bad consequences from stopping this discharge, it
will be proper, especially in children of a gross habit, to make
an issue in the neck or arm, which may be kept open till the
patient becomes more strong, and the constitution be somewhat
mended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>864. <em>Wounded Feet.</em>&mdash;When a nail or pin has been run into
the foot, instantly bind on a rind of salt pork; if the foot swell,
bathe it in a strong decoction of wormwood, then bind on
another rind of pork, and keep quiet till the wound is well.
The lockjaw is often caused by such wounds, if neglected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>865. <em>For a Bruise or Sprain.</em>&mdash;Bathe the part in cold water,
till you can get ready a decoction of wormwood. This is one
of the best remedies for sprains and bruises. When the wormwood
is fresh gathered, pound the leaves and wet them either
with water or vinegar, and bind them on the bruise; when the
herb is dry, put it into cold water, and let it boil a short time,
then bathe the bruise and bind on the herb.</p>

<p>Always keep cotton wool, scraped lint, and wormwood on
hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>866. <em>Ear-ache in Children.</em>&mdash;The ear-ache is usually caused
by a sudden cold. Steam the head over hot herbs, bathe the feet,
and put into the ear cotton wool wet with sweet oil and
paregoric.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>867. <em>To make Artificial Sea Water, for bathing Children.</em>&mdash;Take
common sea salt, two pounds; bitter purging salt, two
ounces, magnesia earth, half an ounce; dissolve all in river
water, six gallons. These are the exact proportions and contents
of sea water, from an accurate analyzation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>868. <em>Another method of making Sea Water.</em>&mdash;Take common
salt, half an ounce; rain, or river water, pure, a pint; spirit of
sea salt, twenty drops. Mix it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>869. <em>Valuable concise Rules for preserving Health in Winter.</em>&mdash;Keep
the feet from wet, and the head well defended when in
bed; avoid too plentiful meals; drink moderately warm and
generous, but not inflaming liquors; go not abroad without
breakfast. Shun the night air as you would the plague; and
let your houses be kept from damps by warm fires. By
observing these few and simple rules, better health may be expected
than from the use of the most powerful medicines.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>870. <em>Avoid, as much as possible, living near Church-yards.</em>&mdash;The
putrid emanations arising from church-yards are very dangerous;
and parish-churches, in which many corpses are interred,
become impregnated with an air so corrupted, especially
in spring, when the ground begins to grow warm, that it is prudent
to avoid this evil as much as possible, as it may be, and,
in some cases, has been, one of the chief sources of putrid fevers
which are so prevalent at that season.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>871. <em>Cautions in visiting Sick Rooms.</em>&mdash;Do not venture into
a sick room if you are in a violent perspiration; for the moment
your body becomes cold, it is in a state likely to absorb
the infection; nor visit a sick person, (if the complaint be of a
contagious nature,) with an <em>empty stomach</em>, nor swallow your
saliva. In attending a sick person, place yourself where the air
passes from the door or window, to the bed of the invalid, not
between the invalid and the fire, as the heat of the fire will
draw the infectious vapor in that direction, and you would run
much danger from breathing in it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>872. <em>Syncope, or Fainting.</em>&mdash;When fainting comes on from
loss of blood, inanition, or sudden emotions of the mind, the
patient should be placed in a horizontal position, with the head
gently raised. Volatile salts should be applied to the nose, and
when the patient is sufficiently recovered, a few spoonfuls of
warm cordial medicine should be administered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>873. <em>Preventive of Autumnal Rheumatisms.</em>&mdash;For the sake
of bright and polished stoves, do not, when the weather is cold,
refrain from making fires. There is not a more useful document
for health to the inhabitants of this climate, than "follow
your feelings."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>874. <em>To promote Sleep.</em>&mdash;No fire, candle, rush-light, or lamp,
should be kept burning, during the night, in a bed-room; for it
not only vitiates the air, but disturbs the nerves of the child.
Keep the bed-chamber well ventilated&mdash;this greatly promotes
healthful rest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>875. <em>Useful Properties of Celandine.</em>&mdash;The juice of this plant
cures tetters and ring-worms, destroys warts, and cures the itch.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>876. <em>Singularly useful Properties of Garlic.</em>&mdash;The smell of
garlic, which is formidable to many ladies, is, perhaps, the
most infallible remedy in the world against the vapors, and all
the nervous disorders to which women are subject. Of this
(says St. Pierre) I have had repeated experience.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>877. <em>The Usefulness of two common Plants.</em>&mdash;Every plant in
the corn-field possesses virtues particularly adapted to the maladies
incident to the condition of the laboring man. The poppy
cures the pleurisy, procures sleep, stops hemorrhages, and spitting
of blood. Poppy seeds form an emulsion similar to that
from almonds in every respect, when prepared in the same manner.
They also yield, by expression, fine salad oil, like that
from Florence. The blue-bottle is diuretic, vulnerary, cordial,
and cooling; an antidote to the stings of venomous insects, and
a remedy for inflammation of the eyes.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>QUALIFICATIONS OF A GOOD NURSE.</h4>

<p>878. <em>Good Temper.</em>&mdash;An even temper is among the principal
qualifications, if not the most desirable one, for a good nurse;
and without this gentleness and a kind manner, she must be
considered deficient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>879. <em>Firmness.</em>&mdash;Next in importance to good temper, are
<em>firmness</em> and decision of character, the exercise of which is
frequently, or rather absolutely indispensable, in the management
of the sick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>880. <em>Discrimination.</em>&mdash;This talent enables the nurse to distinguish
between circumstances which, to an unobserving person,
appear nearly allied to each other, but where there is, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
reality, an important difference. It is only or generally acquired
by experience and observation, and requires good sense
as its foundation and support. It is the faculty of right judgment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>881. <em>Self-denial.</em>&mdash;The business of taking care of the sick,
if rightly attended to, requires a devotion to the interests and
wants of the patient, which can only be given by the good
nurse, who can willingly, and from her heart, practise the
heavenly precepts of doing as she would be done by, and denying
herself any indulgences that interfere with her duties.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>882. <em>General Intelligence.</em>&mdash;Another important qualification
of a good nurse, is such knowledge of reading, and subjects of
general interest, as make her able to interest and amuse her
patient during the weary hours of slow recovery, or desponding
intervals of intermitting diseases.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>883. <em>Abstinence from improper habits.</em>&mdash;The habit of using
snuff in any manner&mdash;smoking&mdash;sipping intoxicating liquors&mdash;taking
opium&mdash;or indulging in any improper and disagreeable
habit of actions or expressions, should be carefully avoided by
those who hold the responsible and important station of nurses
of the sick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>884. <em>Cleanliness.</em>&mdash;This is a cardinal virtue; and no woman
can be a good nurse who is careless in her own apparel, and
slatternly in her habits. In the preparation of food for the sick,
the most scrupulous neatness should be observed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>885. <em>Industry, Economy, and Good Housewifery.</em>&mdash;All three
of these qualifications are essential, and usually associated in
the same person; but, the <em>exercise</em> of qualities is necessary to
their improvement&mdash;and a nurse who has proved herself competent,
is most worthy of being trusted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>886. <em>Prudence and Piety.</em>&mdash;The principles of true discretion,
or prudence of character, are based on the Christian religion,
as are all the moral virtues. The nurse must be religious, or
she will rarely be discreet; and the opportunities constantly
afforded her of influencing the mind and heart of her patient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
render her station one of great trust and responsibility. A
<em>good nurse</em> is a woman that deserves honor as well as reward.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>887. <em>Rules for the Nurse.</em>&mdash;1. Keep the patient's room quiet,
well-aired, and clean as possible.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2. Never excite disagreeable mental emotions in the sick, by
telling sad stories and melancholy news; nor allow the presence
of unpleasant persons or objects.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3. Never whisper, nor seem to be telling what the sick are
not permitted to hear.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4. Administer to the necessities of the invalid, promptly and
kindly; but do not worry him with questions and constant
attentions, when these are not needed.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>5. Never disturb the quiet sleep of the patient, even to give
medicine, unless peremptorily charged to do so by the physician.
A refreshing sleep is often better than medicine, for
the sick; but do not sleep yourself, and allow the suffering one
to lie awake, and needing your care.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>888. <em>Administering Medicine.</em>&mdash;There are certain rules, if
observed in giving medicine, that will render the duty less
disagreeable to the nurse, by making it more tolerable to the
patient.</p>

<p>1st. Select the most agreeable and suitable ingredient in
which it is to be exhibited.</p>

<p>2d. Take as small a quantity of this as can possibly be made
to answer the purpose of mixing.</p>

<p>3d. If it be disagreeable to the taste, prepare the mouth for
its reception by holding in, and rinsing it with some acid, as
strong vinegar, lemon juice, or something of the kind.</p>

<p>4th. Never mix the medicine within sight or hearing of the
patient.</p>

<p>5th. Let it be prepared without her knowledge; and insist
upon its being taken immediately upon being presented, for the
longer her mind is permitted to dwell upon it, the more abhorrent
it will become.</p>

<p>6th. Endeavor to destroy the taste and smell as much as possible,
by any appropriate means, when it has not been done by
the apothecary or physician.</p>

<p>7th. Let the mouth be well rinsed with the acid after taking
it, and let a swallow or two of lemonade, or some other admissible
drink, be taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>889. <em>Plasters and Poultices&mdash;Mustard Plasters.</em>&mdash;Take a sufficient
quantity of bread crumbs finely rubbed, add mustard in
proportion to the required strength; form a poultice of the
proper consistency, by adding vinegar or water. Dr. Wood
thinks water preferable, as he is of the opinion that vinegar destroys
an essential property of the mustard. Mustard employed
for this purpose should be whole grain, fresh as can be procured,
and bruised or mashed in a mortar, or by any other convenient
means. When mustard cannot be procured, horse radish leaves
may be substituted; they must be rolled with a rolling-pin, to
mash and make soft the hard stems, and withered by pouring
over them a little scalding water.</p>

<p>After they have been applied, the feet must be frequently examined
to see that they do not get cold. Often more harm
than good is done by the nurse neglecting this part of her duty.
Burdock and cabbage leaves are frequently directed to be applied
to the feet; they are prepared in the same manner, and
require the same attention.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>890. <em>Spice Plaster.</em>&mdash;Pulverized cloves, cinnamon, and Cayenne
pepper, half an ounce each; mix, and add flour and wine
of galls, or diluted spirits, to form this plaster; lay it hot on
the region of the stomach. It is excellent for pains and spasms.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>891. <em>Alum Cataplasm.</em>&mdash;Take any quantity of the white of
eggs; agitate it with a large lump of alum, till it be coagulated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>892. <em>Cataplasm of common Salt.</em>&mdash;Take crumbs of bread, and
linseed meal, of each equal parts; water, saturated with salt, a
sufficient quantity to give it a proper consistency.</p>

<p>This poultice may be applied to the indolent swellings of the
glands, in scrofulous habits, where the patient is deprived of
the benefit of the sea air and water. A constant use of it will
frequently occasion great inflammation of the skin, requiring
a suspension of its use for a few days; but as soon as the
inflammation subsides, it should be repeated. By the use of
this poultice, strumous humors, and scrofulous enlargements,
of a chronic nature, have been totally dispersed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>893. <em>Cerate of Cantharides.</em>&mdash;Take of spermaceti ointment,
six drachms; cantharides, in fine powder, one drachm. Mix
them together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the proper application to keep up a constant discharge
from the part to which a blister has been applied.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>894. <em>Bark Poultice.</em>&mdash;Take of Peruvian bark, one ounce:
sprinkle it over a piece of thick muslin of the required size;
take another piece of the same size; lay it over the bark, and
quilt them together, to keep the bark to its place; moisten it
with brandy or vinegar. Some of the aromatics may be used
in conjunction with the bark, if indicated.</p>

<p>Let it be worn over the stomach and bowels. It has proved
singularly beneficial in cases of obstinate intermittents, and
debility arising therefrom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>895. <em>Mush Poultice.</em>&mdash;Mush poultices are sometimes ordered;
this constitutes an invaluable application in cases of violent
pain in the stomach and bowels, such as colic, cramp, &amp;c. It
is made by simply boiling the corn-meal until it attains the
proper consistency. It must be spread on a cloth, and applied
as warm as can be endured. We have known the most inveterate
cases relieved by it in fifteen minutes.&mdash;<em>Shore.</em></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>FOOD FOR THE SICK AND FOR CHILDREN.</h4>

<p>896. A few rules, the reasons for which may be found in the
Introductory Remarks of "Mrs. Hale's New Cook Book,"
will be of some advantage here:&mdash;</p>

<p>First. Select those substances that are the most soluble&mdash;that
are readily converted into chyle by the <em>gastric juice</em>.</p>

<p>Second. Those that experience has shown to be the most
nutritious.</p>

<p>Third. Those that contain the least amount of stimulus.</p>

<p>Fourth. These to be given in quantity and frequency proportioned
to the general strength or debility of the patient.</p>

<p>By careful observation, the feelings of the invalid will be
found to furnish the most unequivocal evidence of the truth of
the foregoing principles&mdash;any deviation from which will soon
be attended with symptoms more or less unpleasant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>897. <em>Arrow-root</em>&mdash;Contains, in small bulk, a greater proportion
of nourishment than any other farinaceous substance yet
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Take of arrow-root, one table-spoonful; sweet milk, half a
pint; boiling-water, half a pint: boil these together for a few
moments.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>898. <em>Arrow-root Jelly.</em>&mdash;Take one spoonful of arrow-root, and
cold water sufficient to form a paste; add one pint of boiling
water: stir it briskly, and boil it a few minutes, when it will
become a smooth, clear jelly. A little sugar and sherry wine
may be added, for debilitated patients; but for infants, a drop
or two of the essence of caraway-seed or cinnamon is preferable,
wine being very apt to become acid in the stomach of infants,
and thus disagree with the bowels.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>899. <em>Sago.</em>&mdash;Take two table-spoonfuls of sago, and one pint
of boiling water; stir together, and boil gently, until it thickens.
Wine, sugar, and nutmeg may be added, according to
circumstances.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>900. <em>Boiled Flour.</em>&mdash;Take of fine flour, one pound; tie it up
in a linen cloth as tight as possible, and, after frequently dipping
it in cold water, dredge the outside with flour, till a crust
is formed round it, which will prevent the water soaking into it
while boiling. It is then to be boiled until it becomes a hard,
dry mass.</p>

<p>Two or three spoonfuls of this may be grated, and prepared
in the same manner as arrow-root, for which it forms an excellent
substitute, and can be obtained in the country, where,
perhaps, the other cannot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>901. <em>A nourishing Jelly for a Sick Person.</em>&mdash;Put into a stone
jar or jug, a set of calf's-feet, cut in pieces, a quart of milk,
five pints of water, a little mace, half an ounce of isinglass,
and a handful of hartshorn shavings. Tie some brown paper
over the jug, and put it into the oven with household bread.
When done, strain it through a sieve; and when cold, take off
the fat. Some of it may occasionally be warmed up with wine
and sugar. It is good taken as broth, with herbs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>902. <em>Restorative.</em>&mdash;One ounce of candied eringo-root, one
ounce of sago, one ounce of pearl-barley, and one ounce of rice.
Boil them in four quarts of water, till reduced to half that
quantity. Take a dessert-spoonful either in milk or wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>903. <em>Vegetable Soup.</em>&mdash;Take one turnip, one potato, and
one onion; let them be sliced, and boiled in one quart of water
for an hour; add as much salt and parsley as is agreeable, and
pour the whole on a slice of toasted bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>904. <em>Egg Gruel.</em>&mdash;Boil a pint of new milk; beat two new-laid
eggs to a light froth, and pour in while the milk boils:
stir them together thoroughly, but do not let them boil,
sweeten it with the best of loaf-sugar, and grate in a whole
nutmeg; add a little salt, if you like it. Drink half of it while
it is warm, and the other half in two hours. It is said to be
good for the dysentery, as well as nourishing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>905. <em>Rice Jelly.</em>&mdash;Boil a quarter of a pound of rice-flour with
half a pound of loaf-sugar, in a quart of water, till the whole
becomes one glutinous mass; then strain off the jelly, and let it
stand to cool. This food is very nourishing and beneficial to
invalids.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>906. <em>Gruels.</em>&mdash;Have ready a pint of boiling water, and mix
three large spoonfuls of finely-sifted oat-meal, rye, or Indian,
in cold water; pour it into the skillet while the water boils;
let it boil eight or ten minutes. Throw in a large handful of
raisins to boil, if the patient is well enough to bear them.
When put in a bowl, add a little salt, white sugar, and nutmeg.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>907. <em>Stewed Prunes.</em>&mdash;Stew them very gently in a small
quantity of water, till the stones slip out. Physicians consider
them safe nourishment in fevers.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DRINKS FOR THE SICK.</h4>

<p>908. Water is the beverage prepared by the bountiful Creator
to allay the thirst of all living creatures on the earth; and
when the bare quenching of thirst is the object, clear, pure cold
water is the best drink that can be given: but, when other
objects are to be attained, a combination becomes necessary,
into which, generally, enters an acid, an alkali, a stimulus,
a tonic, or some article of nourishment. In bilious diseases,
acidulated drinks are often found beneficial&mdash;and one of the
best of these is in the form of lemonade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>909. <em>Lemonade.</em>&mdash;Take fresh lemon-juice, four ounces; fresh
and very thin-peeled lemon, half an ounce; white sugar, four
ounces; boiling water, three pints. Let this mixture stand till
cold, then strain for use. As this drink sometimes causes pain
in the bowels, it should not be drank too freely.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>910. <em>Apple-Water.</em>&mdash;Take one tart apple of ordinary size,
well baked; let it be well mashed; pour on it one pint of boiling

Peruvian bark, bruised, one ounce; water, one pint; take of
Valerian root, one ounce; boiling water, one pint; infuse for
one hour and strain. Add the decoction of bark to this infusion,
and give a tea-cupful, cold, three or four times a-day.</p>

<p>This is chiefly employed in rheumatic headache in which it is
sometimes very serviceable. It was a favorite prescription of the
late Dr. Parrish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>920. <em>Chamomile and Orange-peel.</em>&mdash;For this infusion, take
chamomile-flowers, one ounce; orange-peel, half an ounce; cold
water, three pints; soak together twenty-four hours. Take a

<p>The chamomile infusion is more agreeable to the taste when
cold, and is less apt to spoil than when made of boiling water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>921. <em>Wild Cherry-tree Bark.</em>&mdash;Take of this bark, dried and

the digestive organs. A wine-glassful may be given every two
or three hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>925. <em>Infusion for Rheumatism.</em>&mdash;One ounce of gum-guaiacum
must be bruised and put into a pint of French brandy, in which
it must remain for at least thirty hours. When the gum is
dissolved, shake the bottle, and pour a little of this infusion into
rather more than a wine-glassful of tepid water; take this at
bed-time, for three nights.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>926. <em>Mixture for Rheumatism.</em>&mdash;One ounce of salad mustard
must be simmered in a pint of soft water, till the liquor is reduced
to half a pint; strain it through muslin, and add a pint

<p>927. <em>The best Method of obtaining pure Soft Water for Medicinal
Purposes, without distilling it.</em>&mdash;Place an earthen pan in
the fields, at a considerable distance from the smoke of any
town, to catch the rain as it falls. People living in the country,
can easily save this clean, pure rain-water. Set it for an hour

throw it away. Then boil it in four pints and a half of water,
until it be reduced one half.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>931. <em>Laxative Whey.</em>&mdash;Take of the dried buds of the damask
rose, one ounce; rennet whey, one quart. Let them stand together

<hr class="r10" />
<p>932. <em>Wine Whey.</em>&mdash;Wine whey is a cooling and safe drink
in fevers. Set half a pint of sweet milk at the fire, pour in one
glass of wine, and let it remain perfectly still, till it curdles;
when the curds settle, strain it, and let it cool. It should not
get more than blood-warm. A spoonful of rennet-water hastens
the operation. Make palatable with loaf-sugar and nutmeg, if
the patient can bear it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>933. <em>Lemon Syrup, for a Cough.</em>&mdash;To a pint and a half of water,

<p>940. <em>Elder-flower Ointment.</em>&mdash;Gather the buds or earliest
flowers of the elder-bush; simmer these in fresh butter, or
sweet lard; it makes a healing and cooling ointment for the
skin, in cutaneous diseases.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>941. <em>Elder-flower Poultice.</em>&mdash;A poultice of elder-flower tea
and biscuit, is good as a preventive to mortification.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>942. <em>White-bean Poultice.</em>&mdash;Nothing is so good to take down
swellings, as a soft poultice of stewed white beans, put on in a
thin muslin bag, and renewed every hour or two.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>A FEW SIMPLE MIXTURES, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>943. <em>Squill Mixture.</em>&mdash;Take of the milk of ammoniacum,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>946. <em>Infusion of Senna.</em>&mdash;Take of senna leaves, one ounce
and a half; ginger, in powder, one drachm; of boiling distilled,
or rain water, one pint. Macerate for an hour. When cold,
strain off the liquor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>947. <em>Cordial Julep.</em>&mdash;Take of peppermint water, four ounces;
pimento water, two ounces; compound spirit of ammonia,
tincture of castor, of each two drachms. Mix them together.
Dose, two large spoonsful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>948. <em>Mucilage of Quince Seed.</em>&mdash;Take of quince seeds, one
drachm; rain or distilled water, half a pint. Boil over a gentle
fire, until the liquor becomes thick and viscid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>949. <em>Lime Water.</em>&mdash;Take of quick lime, eight ounces; rain
or distilled water, twelve pints. Suffer them to stand together
one hour, then decant the liquor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>950. <em>Alum Whey.</em>&mdash;Take of alum, two drachms; cow's milk,
one pint. Boil them together, until the curd be formed; then
strain off the liquor, and add spirit of nutmeg, two ounces;
syrup of cloves, one ounce.</p>

<p>It is employed with advantage in diabetes, in uterine and
other fluxes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>951. <em>Whortleberries.</em>&mdash;Whortleberries, commonly called
huckleberries, dried, are a useful medicine for children. Made
into tea, and sweetened with molasses, they are very beneficial,
when the system is in a restricted state, and the digestive powers
out of order.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>952. <em>Blackberries.</em>&mdash;Blackberries are extremely useful, in
cases of dysentery. To eat the berries is very healthy; tea,
made of the roots and leaves is beneficial; and a syrup made
of the berries is still better. Blackberries have sometimes
effected a cure when physicians despaired.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>953. <em>Method of causing Children to cut their Teeth easily.</em>&mdash;Feed
them with an ivory spoon and boat&mdash;to be made thick,
round, and smooth at the edges. Ivory being of the same
hardness and texture as the jaws and tender teeth, the gums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
are not hurt or injured, but, when they are thus pressed, facilitate
the teeth in their progress; whereas, the silver implements,
being of a hard texture, and the edges made thin, bruise
and wound the gums, and make a hard seam; so that the teeth
cannot make their way direct, and, if they do cut, come irregularly;
so that the operation of lancing is frequently absolutely
necessary, which, of course, must prejudice the teeth, as some
are exposed before the time they are fit to cut.</p>

<p>By this method, fevers, convulsions, &amp;c., owing to the teeth
being not able to find their way through the hard seam, may
be prevented. It must be often observed, that children cry
much when feeding, as if ill, or disgusted with their food;
whereas it is frequently owing to quite the contrary; for, being
hungry, and over eager to take their food, they press hard,
through eagerness, on the boat and spoon, which, being sharp,
bruises and cuts the gums, and consequently causes great pain,
which, by the ivory implements, will be prevented. Those
who cannot afford ivory, may have horn or wood, or even pewter
is greatly preferable to silver, provided the edges are made
thick, round, and smooth. The wooden sort, unless they are
kept very sweet and clean, on that very account, are the least
eligible, and should be made, however, of box, or such hard
and close-textured wood as is the least liable to be tainted by
the milky food.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>954. <em>Rules for the Preservation of the Teeth and Gums.</em>&mdash;The
teeth are bones, thinly covered over with a fine enamel,
and this enamel is more or less substantial in different persons.
Whenever this enamel is worn through by too coarse a powder,
or too frequently cleaning the teeth, or eaten through by a
scorbutic humor in the gums, the tooth cannot remain long
sound, any more than a filbert-kernel can, when it has been
penetrated by a worm.</p>

<p>The teeth, therefore, are to be cleaned, but with great precaution;
for, if you wear the enamel off faster by cleaning the
outside than nature supplies it within, your teeth will suffer
more by this method, than perhaps by a total neglect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>955. <em>Stammering.</em>&mdash;Impediments in the speech may be cured,
where there is no mal-formation of the organs of articulation,
by perseverance, for three or four months, in the simple remedy
of reading aloud, with the teeth closed, for at least two hours
in the course of each day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>956. <em>Of Preservers, and Rules for the Preservation of Sight.</em>&mdash;Though
it may be impossible to prevent the absolute decay of
sight, whether arising from age, partial disease, or illness, yet,
by prudence and good management, its natural failure may
certainly be retarded, and the general habits of the eyes strengthened,
which good purposes will be promoted by a proper attention
to the following maxims:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Never sit for any length of time in absolute gloom, or
exposed to a blaze of light. The reasons on which this rule is
founded, prove the impropriety of going hastily from one extreme
to the other, whether of darkness or of light, and show
us that a southern aspect is improper for those whose sight is
weak and tender.</p>

<p>2. Avoid reading small print.</p>

<p>3. Never read in the dark; nor, if the eyes be disordered,
by candle-light. Happy those who learn this lesson betimes,
and begin to preserve their sight before they are reminded by
pain of the necessity of sparing them. The frivolous attention
to a quarter of an hour in the evening, has cost numbers the
perfect and comfortable use of their eyes for many years; the
mischief is effected imperceptibly&mdash;the consequences are inevitable.</p>

<p>4. The eye should not be permitted to dwell on glaring
objects, more particularly on first waking in the morning; the
sun should not, of course, be suffered to shine in the room at
that time, and a moderate quantity of light only be admitted.
It is easy to see that, for the same reasons, the furniture of a
bed should be neither altogether of a white or red color; indeed,
those whose eyes are weak, would find considerable advantage
in having green for the furniture of their bed-chamber. Nature
confirms the propriety of the advice given in this rule; for the
light of the day comes on by slow degrees, and green is the
universal color she presents to our eyes.</p>

<p>5. The long-sighted should accustom themselves to read with
rather less light, and somewhat nearer to the eye than what
they naturally like; while those that are short-sighted, should
rather use themselves to read with the book as far off as possible:
by this means, both would improve and strengthen
their sight; while a contrary course will increase its natural
imperfections.</p>

<p>There is nothing which preserves the sight longer than always
using, both in reading and writing, that moderate degree of light
which is best suited to the eye: too little, strains them&mdash;too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
great a quantity, dazzles and confounds them. The eyes are
less hurt by the want of light, than by the excess of it: too little
light never does any harm, unless they are strained by efforts
to see objects to which the degree of light is inadequate; but
too great a quantity has, by its own power, destroyed the sight.
Thus, many have brought on themselves a cataract, by frequently
looking at the sun or a fire; others have lost their sight
by being brought too suddenly from an extreme of darkness
into the blaze of day. How dangerous the looking on bright,
luminous objects, is to the sight, is evident from its effects in
those countries which are covered, the greater part of the year,
with snow, where blindness is exceedingly frequent, and where
the traveller is obliged to cover his eyes with crape, to prevent
the dangerous and often sudden effects of too much light: even
the untutored savage tries to avoid the danger, by framing a
little wooden case for his eyes, with only two narrow slits. A
momentary gaze at the sun will, for a time, unfit the eyes for
vision, and render them insensible to impressions of a milder
nature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>957. <em>The Feet</em>&mdash;Should be washed in cold water every morning,
and wiped very dry. Stockings, if too small, cripple the
feet as surely as small shoes. Always be careful to give the
foot room enough, and you will be rarely troubled with corns.
When the toe-nails have a tendency to turn in, so as to be
painful, the nail should always be kept scraped <em>very thin</em>, and
as near the flesh as possible. As soon as the corner of the nail
can be raised up out of the flesh, it should be kept from again
entering, by putting a tuft of fine lint under it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>958. <em>For Sore Feet.</em>&mdash;The thin white skin which comes from
suet, is excellent to bind upon the feet, for chilblains. Rubbing
with Castile soap, and afterwards with honey, is likewise highly
recommended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>959. <em>A Vapor-Bath at home.</em>&mdash;Place <em>strong</em> sticks across a
tub of water, at the boiling-point, and sit upon them, entirely
enveloped in a blanket, feet and all. The steam from the water
will be a vapor-bath. Some people put herbs into the water.
Steam-baths are excellent for severe colds, and for some disorders
in the bowels. They should not be taken without the advice
of an experienced nurse or physician. Great care should be taken
not to renew the cold after; it would be doubly dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>RULES FOR WOMEN SERVANTS.</h4>

<p>960. <em>Of the Cookmaid.</em>&mdash;When a young woman undertakes
the situation of cookmaid in a family, where only one or two
other servants are kept, she will have many duties to perform,
besides preparing and dressing the provisions, although that is
her principal business. What those duties are, will, of course,
depend very much upon the habits of the family with whom
she lives; and whether there is a man-servant or a boy kept;
as, if not, the cleaning of knives, shoes, and various things that
would be done by them, become the business of the cook-maid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>961. <em>General duties of the Cookmaid.</em>&mdash;The part of the house
in which her chief work lies is the kitchen; but she is also expected
to clean the passage or hall, the stone door-steps, the
bell-pull, name-plate, knocker, and all things outside the house
which are kept cleaned; also, the kitchen stairs, pantry, servants'
offices, and areas; and, in many families, the dining-room
as well as the kitchen windows, and the light over or at
the sides of the hall door. It is her place to scour the dresser,
table, shelves, &amp;c., in the kitchen and pantry, and to keep both
places clean and in order; to wash the plates and dishes, to
keep the saucepans and all other vessels used in cooking, or for
keeping eatables in, perfectly clean, so that they may always
be ready for use; to wash and keep the pudding-cloths sweet
and clean; to sweep the carpet, and clean the grate, fender,
fire-irons, and hearth, in the breakfast-parlor; to clean the
kitchen candlesticks; to assist the housemaid in making the
beds after they have been laid open to air; to answer the door
to the trades-people; and, if there is no man-servant, nor boy
kept, to brush the clothes and shoes of the gentlemen of the
family.</p>

<p>It is of great importance that the cookmaid should be cleanly
in her person, as well as in her cooking; and that she should
never be seen with dirty hands, which may be easily prevented
by using thick gloves, when blacking a stove or doing any
other dirty work, and always washing her hands as soon as
she has finished. Nothing can be more disagreeable than to
see the person who prepares one's meals with dirty hands
or apron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>962. <em>Arrangements for Work in the Kitchen.</em>&mdash;The cookmaid
should always be furnished with her own pails, brushes, flannels,
and everything she requires for her own work, and should
never use the housemaid's pails or brushes, nor suffer the
housemaid to use hers. A strict attention to this rule prevents
much discomfort and confusion, and the work is sure to
be done with more regularity, and much time saved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>963. <em>Work in the Breakfast-room.</em>&mdash;Your work in the breakfast-room
generally is to light the fire, clean the stove, fender,
fire-irons, and hearth; take up the ashes, sweep the carpet,
shake the hearth-rug, and lay it down again; but this is sometimes
varied in different families. If you find there are more
cinders than you can use for lighting the fire, you should take
them down to burn in the kitchen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>964. <em>Of Neatness in the Breakfast-room.</em>&mdash;In order to avoid
soiling the carpet in the breakfast-parlor, while you are lighting
the fire and cleaning the stove, you should have a piece of drugget,
about a yard wide and two yards long, or cloth of some
kind, to lay down; but whichever you use, always use it the
dirty side upwards. Without this precaution, the most careful
person cannot prevent the carpet from getting dirty before
the fire-place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>965. <em>Punctuality in Servants.</em>&mdash;Punctuality is a very essential
quality in a cookmaid, who ought to regulate her work so
that the dinner should always be ready at the appointed time;
and to avoid any mistake in this particular, she should know
precisely the length of time required to cook each kind of food,
according to the taste of those for whom she cooks, and then
she should allow herself about fifteen to twenty minutes more,
to take up the dinner, and for any little hindrance that may
occur, she will be tolerably exact. The best means of being
punctual is to keep everything in its proper place, and fit for
use, so that no time may be lost in looking for this thing or
that, or in having to clean any utensils that may be wanted for
cooking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>966. <em>Economy in the Kitchen.</em>&mdash;Never waste anything, but
have places and purposes for all articles in your keeping.
Habits of economy are easily acquired, and the cookmaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
would do well to consider how much more valuable she must
be to her employers, and how much more she will be respected,
if she be careful, and make the most of the property that is
intrusted to her charge, than if she uses it wastefully.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>967. <em>Cleaning the Hall, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;If you are quick with the
breakfast-parlor work, you will, very likely, have time to clean
the door-steps and passage before breakfast, which is much better
than leaving them till afterwards: but this will, of course,
depend on the breakfast-hour, as you must not, on any account,
neglect to see that the water in the kettle is boiling, the urn-iron
hot, and everything ready to take up the moment it is
wanted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>968. <em>Making Breakfast.</em>&mdash;If you have toast to make, or bacon
to cook, take care to have a clear fire, so that it may be done
quickly, when wanted, and not before; for both toast and bacon
should be hot from the fire, and not suffered to stand after
they are done. Dry toast should be thin and crisp; to keep it
so, set it on its edge in the toast-rack, directly it is made.</p>

<p>Never boil eggs by guess; if you have no clock in the
kitchen, you should have a sand-glass or egg-boiler, for in
guessing at the time, it is not possible to be quite exact, and
half a minute too much or too little will spoil an egg. It is the
duty of the cookmaid to prepare the breakfast; and that of the
housemaid to carry it up to the breakfast-parlor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>969. <em>Cold Meats at Breakfast.</em>&mdash;In some families, whatever
cold meat or cold poultry may have been left from the previous
day, is served up at breakfast; in which case it is the cookmaid's
duty to send it up, laid out neatly on clean and rather
small-sized dishes, with breakfast plates and small clean knives
and forks; sometimes it will require a little putting to rights,
by trimming, and garnishing with a few sprigs of parsley,
which, of course, she will attend to.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>970. <em>To arrange for Children, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;If the children of the
family breakfast in the nursery, or require to go to school
early, you will, most probably, be expected to cut their bread
and butter, and get their breakfast ready for them; or, at all
events, assist in doing so. It is your place also to get the
kitchen breakfast ready for yourself and the housemaid, &amp;c.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and it will materially add to the comfort of your situation, if
you take care to keep your table-cloth clean, and neatly folded,
so that it may not have an untidy appearance when spread
upon the table; and let the knives, and all the things you use
for yourself and fellow servants, be clean like those you send
up to the table of the family.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>971. <em>Taking Directions for Dinner.</em>&mdash;In most families, it is
the custom of the lady of the house, to go into the kitchen every
morning, to make arrangements with the cook about the
dinner, and to give out from the store-closet such things as may
be required for the day's use, either by the cookmaid or housemaid.
You must then remember to ask for whatever you will
want, so that you may not have to give trouble a second time.
Some ladies prefer that the cookmaid should come into the
parlor, to receive directions. Should this be the custom, you
should make it a rule to wash your hands, and put on a clean
apron, before you go in. There are some foolish servants, who
have a mistaken notion that a lady should not trouble herself
much with her kitchen; but every one ought to have the good
sense to know that it is the province and duty of a mistress to
superintend the order and management of every part of her
household; and those servants who are conscious that they
waste not, and perform their duties to the best of their ability,
will never feel an objection; but, on the contrary, will be
pleased that their mistress should see that they do so.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>972. <em>Making Beds, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;When you have taken orders about
dinner, you should go up into the bed-rooms, to assist the
house-maid in making the beds&mdash;having already washed your
hands, and put on your clean bed-apron. It is very proper to
keep a bed-apron entirely for this purpose, one that will wrap
quite round you, and tie together behind; and to take it off,
and fold it up, as soon as the beds are made. It will serve
for a week, with care; therefore, if you make a rule to put on
a clean one every Monday morning, the bed-clothes and furniture
will never get soiled by rubbing against your gown or
clothes. Attention to such little niceties as these is so easy,
that it is surprising any one should neglect them, particularly
as they make all the difference between a good servant and a
bad one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>973. <em>Arrangement of the Dinner-Table.</em>&mdash;Always have the
salt-cellars filled with fine clean salt, and the cruets and cruet-stand
dusted; and that each of the cruets are about half-full
of vinegar, oil, pepper, sugar, &amp;c., such as they are intended to
hold; and although this is the housemaid's duty, it is only kind
in the cookmaid to give the housemaid all the information she
may require or ask for; a good dinner will look very unhandsome,
unless the housemaid takes care that the salts and
cruets are clean, and sufficiently filled to accompany it to table.
The housemaid should also see that the mustard-cruet is quite
clean, before it is put on the table; for if the mustard is dried
on the edges, or on the spoon, it has a very disagreeable appearance,
and betokens an untidy servant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>974. <em>The Dinner-Hour, and its Duties.</em>&mdash;In order more surely
to be correct to the dinner-hour, allow yourself from fifteen
to twenty minutes for taking up the dinner, and for any hindrances
that may occur; and take care to have the fire made up
in proper time for cooking&mdash;regulating the size of it according
to what you have to cook. It should be stirred as little as
possible while you are cooking; indeed, a good cookmaid stirs
her fire only once during her roasting, and that is when she
turns the meat, or alters the hanging of it, at which times she
takes the meat and dripping-pan away from the fire, as stirring
creates both dust and smoke; but as dust or coal may, by accident,
fall into the dripping-pan, keep ready a dish-cloth, to
wipe it out directly. Be mindful, also, to keep in the house
a stock of the things that are commonly wanted, such as flour,
salt, pepper, spices, &amp;c.; but always make a point of using up
what you had, before you begin upon the fresh supply; and
be sure to put them away into their proper places, as you
receive them&mdash;as mustard, pepper, spices, tea, coffee, &amp;c., will
spoil, if kept in the papers they are sent home in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>975. <em>Of Re-cooking.</em>&mdash;In cities, where the master of the house
is often engaged in business until late in the day, the dinner-hour
may be as late as four or five o'clock; in that case, there
is an early dinner for the children and servants, for whom a
pudding is usually to be made. It is a very material part of
your business to know how to dress over, nicely, anything left
from the preceding day's dinner, so that it may be used in the
kitchen, if not required in the dining-room. For this purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
you should, when a joint is brought down from the dining-room,
put it on a clean dish, and pour the gravy into a small basin
or jelly-pot, and you will find it very useful in making nice,
savory dishes of cold meat, or to put into hashes and stews,
or warming up for gravy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>976. <em>Hot Plates for Dinner.</em>&mdash;Before sending up dinner, take
care that you have enough hot plates. It is better to heat a
few more than the exact number, lest an extra one may be
wanted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>977. <em>Serving up Dinner.</em>&mdash;Whilst the dinner is being served
up, the cook-maid may be required to assist, by taking the
dishes to the door of the dining-parlor; also, in some families,
by taking them from the housemaid, or from the outside of the
dining-room door, when they are done with, that the housemaid,
if she waits at dinner, may not have to leave the room.
And the cookmaid will save herself much time and trouble,
if she gets her dish-tub, in the sink, half filled with hot water,
so that she may put the dishes and plates into it the moment
they are brought from the dinner-table.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>978. <em>Washing Dishes.</em>&mdash;The dirty dishes and plates should
be put into a dish-tub of warm water, immediately they are
taken from the dinner table; for, by this means, half the
trouble of washing-up will be saved, as it will prevent the
gravy, mustard, juice, &amp;c., from cooling and drying on the
plates and dishes. When you commence washing them, add
sufficient boiling water to make it hot enough to wash them in,
and with a dish-cloth wash them clean on both sides, one at a
time. Rinse them immediately, in a pan full of cold water,
part of which should stand under the tap, which should be
turned a little on to keep it full. The reason for keeping the
pan full of water and running over, is, that any grease, &amp;c.,
which may rinse off the plates and dishes, may swim over into
the sink in the act of rinsing, otherwise it would remain on the
water, and make those you rinse, after the first few, look
greasy, instead of clean and bright.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>979. <em>Washing Saucepans, Kettles, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;When you have
washed all the dishes and plates used at dinner, as above directed,
and put them in the rack to drain, the saucepans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
kettles which have been used for cooking, should next be
cleaned. The proper plan is to fill them with cold water as
soon as the food has been taken out of them, as, by this means,
whatever may hang about the sides cannot stick close, nor dry
on hard, and they will clean much more readily. If the insides
are discolored or dirty, a little soda or wood-ash is the best
thing to clean them with; or, if they are very dirty, the wood-ashes,
or some soda, must be boiled up in them. They should
afterwards be well rinsed with boiling-hot water, wiped, and
made perfectly dry, by being placed for some time bottom upwards,
before the kitchen fire. The upper rims of saucepans,
and the rims and insides of the lids, must be kept quite clean.
If tin saucepans are not completely dry, they will soon get
rusty, and if copper ones are not perfectly cleaned and dried,
they become poisonous. Never leave food of any kind in a
saucepan to become cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>980. <em>Washing Pudding-cloths, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Pudding-cloths should
be washed as soon as possible after the puddings are taken out
of them. They should be washed in clean warm water, without
soap, rinsed and thoroughly dried before being folded and
put in the kitchen drawer, otherwise they will give a musty
smell to the puddings that are next boiled in them. The
paste-brush, egg-whisk and sieves must also be washed, first in
cold and then in warm water, and put away clean and dry, or
they will spoil whatever you use them for afterwards. All
things through which eggs are strained, should be washed, first
in cold and then in hot water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>981. <em>Cleaning the Sink.</em>&mdash;First, wipe into one corner and
take up all the little bits of gristle, fat, or vegetables, or whatever
else may have collected in the sink; and, if you live in or
near to a town, throw it on the back part of the top of the
kitchen fire; for, if thrown into the dust-bin, it will either entice
rats or other vermin, or else cause an offensive and unwholesome
smell. If forced down the sink holes, the same unpleasant
consequences will follow, besides stopping-up and destroying
the drains. But if you live in the country where a pig is
kept, it may be thrown into the pig tub with the dish washings.</p>

<p>You must next clean the sink, which, if of stone, is best done
with a hard brush and a little soda; or, if of lead, with the following
mixture:&mdash;One pennyworth of pearlash, one pennyworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of soft-soap, and one pennyworth of fuller's-earth, (the fuller's-earth
dried,) mixed together in a pipkin, or something of the
kind, with a quart of water. About a table-spoonful of this on
a piece of flannel will clean the leaden sink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>982. <em>Cleaning the Spit, Frying-pan, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;The spit, if one is
used, must also be always perfectly cleaned when done with.
A little dripping rubbed on a hot frying-pan or gridiron, after
cleaning it, will greatly remove the smell and taste of fish; but
some persons rub a little salt well about the inside of a hot
frying-pan, with a piece of clean paper, which also removes the
taste of fish or onions. If these things are put away into damp
places, they will soon become unfit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>983. <em>Cabbage-water to be thrown away.</em>&mdash;Always remember
that green water, that is, water in which cabbage, or any other vegetable
is boiled, should be thrown down the sink the moment
the vegetables are out of it, while it is quite hot, and then a
pailful of cold water thrown after it, will prevent the unhealthy
smell arising from green water; but if it be left till it is cold,
or nearly cold before you throw it away, twenty pails of water
thrown after it will not prevent the smell.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>984. <em>Scalding Milk vessels.</em>&mdash;Be careful to scald every vessel
which has contained milk, having previously let it stand for
some time filled with cold water, and never let any other
liquid be put into it till it has undergone this process; or whatever
you put in will be spoiled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>985. <em>Cleaning Bread-pans, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Your pan for keeping bread
should be wiped out every day, and scalded once a week; in
the same way clean the cheese-pan, or both your bread and
cheese will become mouldy and musty; and cheese should
always be kept standing on its <em>rind</em>; and the rind should be
scraped before it is sent to the table.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>986. <em>Keeping Beer.</em>&mdash;You should not let beer stand in a pot
or jug; but, if there be any left, put it into a clean bottle, with
a tea-spoonful of sugar, and cork it tightly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>987. Never suffer two things to be put together, which would
give to each other a disagreeable taste or flavor. Never cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
bread, or butter, or meat, with a knife which has been used
for cheese or onions, or the bread, butter, or meat will taste of
them. Therefore, you should put the knife which you have
used for these purposes, in some place separate from the other
knives, and never allow it to be put with them until it has
been properly cleaned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>988. <em>Washing Pickle and Preserve-Jars.</em>&mdash;Whenever pickle
or preserve jars are empty, wash them well in cold water&mdash;dry
them thoroughly&mdash;and put them in a dry place. If you wash
pickle or preserve-jars in hot water, it will crack their glazed
surface, and make them porous, which spoils them for use, as
pickles and preserves require to have the air kept from them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>989. <em>Cleaning Dish-Covers.</em>&mdash;Dish-covers should always be
wiped and polished as soon as they are removed from the table.
If this is done whilst they are warm, it will be but little trouble;
but, if the steam be allowed to dry on them, you will find much
difficulty in getting the tarnish off from the insides. When
they are wiped and polished, hang them up in their places immediately.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>990. <em>Of the Paste-Board, Rolling-Pin, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;After making
puddings or pastry, wash your rolling-pin and paste-board,
without soap, and put it away quite dry. Never use, nor allow
others to use, any of the family dinner or tea-service, in the
kitchen; as, if one thing be broken, it would perhaps spoil a
valuable set; but, always use for cooking, the plates, dishes,
and cups, provided for that purpose, which are usually plain,
and though of course equally clean, are much less expensive.
Keep the bread, cheese, butter, flour, dripping, milk, eggs, and
every thing else you may require in cooking, in their distinct
and separate places; and be careful to put them away as soon
as you have done with them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>991. <em>Of keeping Hot Water.</em>&mdash;It is highly necessary that you
should keep a plentiful supply of hot water, by constantly
filling-up the boiler whenever water is taken out of it. A self-acting
boiler does not require to be filled, as it fills itself as
fast as the water is drawn out; but you must be very careful
in frosty weather, to watch whether the water continues to run;
for if the water in the pipes becomes frozen, and you allow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
boiler to get empty, the consequence is almost sure to be, that
when the frost melts, the cold water comes suddenly into the
hot boiler, and splits it. The damage can only be repaired by
having a new boiler, which costs, perhaps, from ten to twenty-five
dollars; so you may see how important it is that you
should prevent so serious an accident.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>992. <em>Of Ventilating Rooms.</em>&mdash;Do not keep your kitchen
always hot, and be sure you let in fresh air. If the attention
of every master or mistress of a family turned to the ventilation
of their dwelling, it would be greatly the means of insuring
health. One single ventilator in the uppermost staircase window,
would effect a great deal. Great attention ought to be
paid to letting the chamber-windows down from the top, frequently
through the day, particularly where the family sits.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>993. <em>Of preparing Tea.</em>&mdash;When the tea-time arrives, it is
your duty to cut the bread-and-butter, or make the toast. You
should never send up more than one or two rounds of buttered
toast at once, according to the number to partake of it, that it
may be hot and fresh when it is handed round. You must cut
off the crusts as close as you can, after it is made and buttered.
If a tea-urn is used, it will be your duty to get it ready in time,
and put in the boiling water when it is wanted: you must also
remember to make the urn-iron red-hot, by putting it into the
kitchen fire after dinner, or at least for an hour before tea-time.
When you use the tea-urn, be careful to do as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take care that the water boils, and that the urn-heater is
red-hot; then, in the first place, dust the urn, and put the boiling
water into it, before you put in the heater; and, to prevent
giving an unpleasant taste, or spoiling the boiling water by
dust, or particles of the hot iron, (which may rub off the heater
as you are putting it into its place,) be careful to put on the
round rim, or ring, before you put in the red-hot heater; and
be sure, also, to avoid pouring any water into the place where
the heater goes; otherwise, when the iron is put in, the steam
may fly up in your face, and scald you seriously. Taking the
urn up into the parlor or drawing-room, is the housemaid's
business; and she should not forget the rug to place it on, or
the heat issuing from it will certainly spoil the polished table:
and it is also the housemaid's business to empty the urn when
done with, which she must be careful to turn upside down, to
drain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>994. <em>Taking care of the Fire.</em>&mdash;The cookmaid's last duties
of the day, are&mdash;to take great care that the kitchen fire is so
nearly out, as to be quite safe; and that nothing is left hanging
before the fire-place; then she must see that the kitchen windows
and shutters are fastened, and lock and bolt all the doors
and windows that have not been fastened earlier in the evening.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>995. <em>Cleaning Knives, Forks, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;If a lad or man-servant
is kept, he cleans the steel knives and forks, as well as the
shoes and boots; and also brushes the gentlemen's clothes:
but, in that large number of families who keep no boy nor man,
it becomes the business of the cookmaid to clean the steel
knives and forks. [See the best manner of preparing the knife-board,
&amp;c., in another part of this book.]</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>996. <em>Care of Table-Knives.</em>&mdash;Be careful to keep a good edge
to your knives, and do your utmost to preserve them from
notches, especially the carving-knife, otherwise a hot joint may
get cold while the knife has to be sent from table to be sharpened.
A keen edge may be given by cleaning alone, if care
be taken, in passing the knife from you, not to let the edge
lean on the board, but, in drawing it towards you, to lean with
a little pressure on the edge.</p>

<p>The knives which are not in daily use, should, after being
wiped with a dry cloth, be put into the cases, or wrapped in
very dry brown paper, and so placed as not to touch each other,
the same way as the cutlers keep them. Great care should be
taken that the place in which they are put is perfectly dry&mdash;as
all articles made of steel have a tendency to contract rust,
that metal having the property of extracting damp from the
atmosphere, or from anything moist near to it. If the ivory
handles of the knives and forks get stained, or become discolored,
mix a table-spoonful of water with a few drops of spirits of
salt&mdash;rub it well on with a little bit of clean rag&mdash;wash it off
with cold water&mdash;and wipe them perfectly dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>997. <em>Of cleaning Boots and Shoes.</em>&mdash;Where no man-servant
is kept, the cook or housemaid must clean the shoes and boots.
First, scrape the dirt off the shoe with a wooden knife, or piece
of firewood, cut to something of an edge. When the worst
of the dirt is thus taken off, use your hard brush to remove
the remainder, or the leather will never be bright. Stir the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
blacking with a short fine sponge, tied round one end of it;
and, with this, put some blacking on the blacking-brush, and
black the shoe all over; use the polishing-brush directly, while
it remains damp, and rub it lightly, yet briskly, till the shoe
shines perfectly bright. When boots or shoes are laid down
before a fire to dry, let them be placed at a good distance, or
the leather will harden and shrink, and the shoes get out of
shape.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>998. <em>Of cleaning Candlesticks.</em>&mdash;It is the duty of the cookmaid
to clean the chamber candlesticks used by the servants,
and the candlesticks belonging to the kitchen (those used by
the family in the parlors, drawing-rooms, and best bed-rooms,
belong to the housemaid's work). Before you commence, have
a sheet of thick brown paper laid on a table, or on whatever
else you intend to clean them, to save making a grease. Then
scrape off the grease on to the brown paper with a piece of firewood,
and put all you scrape off into your kitchen-stuff. The
candlesticks should then be put, upside down, in the deepest
candlestick, at a little distance from the fire, so that all the
grease may melt, and drain into one. This grease should also
be put into the kitchen stuff, and the candlesticks wiped perfectly
clean with the candlestick-rag, or with a cloth kept for
that purpose. The polishing should be done with a little dry
rotten-stone, or dry whiting, put on a leather. The cookmaid
has usually a candle-box provided for her, into which she puts
all the pieces of candle, for kitchen use. This box should be
lined with white paper, which should be frequently renewed, or
the candles will become very dirty, and be unpleasant to burn,
from bits of the snuff sticking to them. Always set the candles
in the candlesticks in the fore part of the day, that they be
ready when wanted, and that all the dirty work may be done
before cooking commences.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>999. <em>Washing-Day.</em>&mdash;If the washing be done at home, the
cookmaid will have to assist; and the changes of linen, and the
kitchen things, usually fall to her share. She generally folds
and irons all but the fine things and the dresses. It is usual
also for her to fill the copper; and for the housemaid to sort
the clothes ready for the wash. Much time as well as labor
will be saved by preparing the clothes for the wash the day before
the washing-day; that is by putting them in soak, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
fine things and coarse things in different tubs, after having examined,
and rubbed with soap such places as are most dirty,
such as the collars and wristbands of shirts, the parts of table-cloths
cloths which are most soiled, and any place in the different articles
which would require more than usual rubbing. Indeed,
everything should be prepared the day before; the copper filled
with soft water, the tubs rinsed and wiped, inside and out
(taking care that they do not leak). The best way to prevent
the tubs from leaking, is to turn them bottom upwards after
using, and keep the bottom filled with water, without which
they will not only leak but fall to pieces, in summer weather.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1000. <em>Care of Clothes-lines, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Clothes-lines, when done
with, should be wiped quite clean, and put away dry in a bag,
for future use, or they will dirty the clothes. A bag should
also be kept for the pegs; and both bags should be kept in a
dry place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1001. <em>Folding and Mangling.</em>&mdash;Before you begin to fold the
clothes, let the board be quite clean and dry, and a clean linen
cloth placed upon it. Separate those things which are to be
mangled, and those which are for rough-drying. Turn shirts,
shifts, night-gowns, pillow-cases, petticoats, &amp;c., the right side
outwards; fold them very smoothly, and sprinkle them to a
proper dampness for ironing. If the collars, wristbands, and
frills, or pleated front of a shirt, be dipped in a little starch,
then into water, and rolled up without squeezing, it will bring
the whole of the shirt to a proper dampness, when it has lain
for some time.</p>

<p>The articles usually mangled are, sheets, towels, table-linen,
pillow-cases, and other straight things; but if there be any
folds, they will not look well when mangled. Pearl-buttons
will break in the mangle, and cut the cloth, therefore, all things
with buttons, and even pillow-cases, if they have buttons,
should not be mangled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1002. <em>Of Ironing.</em>&mdash;The ironing-blanket should be made of
a thick kind of flannel, called swan's-skin, and a coarse cloth
should be spread between it and the board. When you are
ironing, be careful to try your iron first upon some coarse
article, or one of little value, for fear of its soiling or singeing
the better clothes. Let the heat be in proportion to the article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
you are about to iron, and be sure to make every part perfectly
smooth.</p>

<p>After they are ironed, the things should be hung upon the
horse to air. The cookmaid is now done with the washing,
as it is the housemaid's business to air them, and to place them
in the drawers, when aired; but in many families, the putting
of them away is done by the mistress of the house, or by some
of the young ladies.</p>

<p>In ironing the skirts of dresses, it is best and most proper to
have a board about thirteen inches wide and four feet long, on
which fasten, with tapes, an ironing-blanket; place one end of
it on a table, and the other end on the dresser, or something
that is firm, of the same height as the table. In using this
board, pass it through the skirt, taking care that the wet part
of the dress falls into a clothes-basket, or a cloth, which you
must first put on the floor, under the middle of the board, to
save the skirt from being soiled; and turn the skirt of the dress
round the board, as you iron it.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1003. <em>Save the Rags.</em>&mdash;All rags of cotton or linen should be
saved by the cookmaid; they should never be thrown away
because they are not clean. Mop-rags, lamp-rags, all should
be washed, dried and put in the rag-bag. There is no need of
expending soap on them; just boil them out in the suds after
you have done washing.</p>

<p>Linen rags should be carefully saved; for they are extremely
useful in sickness. If they have become dirty and
worn by cleaning silver, &amp;c., wash them, and scrape them into
lint.</p>

<p>1004. <em>Advantage of Knowing something about Agriculture.</em>&mdash;In
a work designed, chiefly, for women, it may seem odd to find
farming treated of, as though they needed such information.
But while far the greater portion of American men<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> are tillers
of the soil, it would be questioning the good sense as well
as affection of their wives and daughters to suppose them indifferent
to such pursuits.</p>

<p>The husband will work with more pleasure, when feeling his
wife takes an interest in his employments. The daughter of a
farmer should be ready to read her father's books and papers
on agriculture, whenever he desires it, and assist in the garden,
orchard, and among domestic animals, when such cases are
suitable for her.</p>

<p>So, trusting you have a garden-hoe and pruning-knife for
your own use, and can assist in transplanting flowers and
shrubs, I shall give rules for these, and also a few hints on
other matters connected with country life and the economy of
farming. These rules are selected, chiefly, from British authorities.
England is famous for its agricultural science and modes
of gardening, and planting trees. Such knowledge and taste are
much needed in our land. But be careful, fair girl and comely
matron, and do not expose your health or injure your personal
appearance while <em>helping</em> in out-door work. A <em>sun-bonnet or
broad-brimmed straw hat and thick gloves</em> should always be
worn, when engaged in such employments.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1005. <em>Important Fact in Agriculture.</em>&mdash;Whatever may be
the nature of the soil, or of the crop cultivated, it should always
be the aim of the farmer to grow full crops. Partial and sometimes
extensive failures will even then but too often occur; but
to neglect making the best known preparations, or only to prepare
for half a crop, has a direct tendency to unprofitable
farming.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1006. <em>Manure for Clover.</em>&mdash;Some farmers make it a rule to
spread about fifty bushels per acre of ashes over their clover in
March, which they find, from long experience, to be a good
manure for this grass. Wood-ashes will be useful on any soil;
coal-ashes chiefly on stiff clays. On the stiff soils of some parts
of Buckinghamshire, ashes of all kinds are much esteemed, and
have risen to a high price.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1007. <em>How to preserve Manure.</em>&mdash;Put it in heaps, and cover
it with earth two feet deep. Never leave manure in the barn
yard; put it all, year by year, on your land.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1008. <em>Dr. Taylor's Easy Method of ascertaining the Qualities
of Marl, Lime Stones, or Quick Lime, for the purposes of Agriculture.</em>&mdash;This
was a communication by Dr. Taylor to the Manchester
Agricultural Society; the general use of marl and
lime as manures, having prompted him to point out the importance
of an easy and certain method of determining the qualities
of different earths and stones, and ascertaining the quantity of
calcareous earth in their composition; their value, in agriculture,
commonly increasing in proportion to the greater quantity
of it which they contain. The process recommended is thus
described:&mdash;The marl or stone being dried, and reduced to
powder, put half an ounce of it into a half pint glass, pouring
in clear water till the glass is half full; then gradually add a
small quantity of strong marine acid, commonly called spirit
of salt, and stir the mixture well together. As soon as the
effervescence thus excited subsides, add a little more marine
acid; thus continuing the operation while any of the earthy
matter appears to dissolve; and till the liquor, after being well
stirred and allowed to stand for half an hour, appears sensibly
acid to the taste. When the mixture has subsided, if the liquor
above it be colorless, that marl or lime-stone is the best which
leaves the least in quantity of sediment or deposit in the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of the glass. This experiment is sufficient to determine
which of the samples tried is the most proper for the uses of
agriculture: as pure calcareous earth or lime, which is the
earth useful in agriculture, will be entirely dissolved; but clay
or sand will not be sensibly acted on by the acid. Where great
accuracy is required in determining the experiment, lay a soft
spongy paper, of which the weight is exactly taken, in an
earthen colander&mdash;for no metallic vessel, or implement for stirring,
&amp;c., must be used in any part of the process&mdash;and, pouring
the saturated mixture of earth and acid on it, let all the
liquor filter through, then pour a little clear water over the
earthy matter remaining on the filter; and, when that water has
also filtered through, dry the paper with the earthy matter on
it which remains undissolved, when the deficiency found, on
weighing them, from their original weight, will discover what
portion of the marle or lime has been dissolved in the acid.
What quantity of earthy matter has been dissolved may be
made evident to the sight, by gradually adding, to the liquor
which has been filtered through the paper, a clear solution of
pearl-ashes, or ashes of burnt wood; this will occasion a precipitation
of the contained lime or calcareous earth to the
bottom of the vessel, which precipitate must be dried and
weighed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1009. <em>To preserve Seeds, when sown, from Vermin.</em>&mdash;Steep
the grain or seed three or four hours, or a sufficient time for it
to penetrate the skin, or husk, in a strong solution of liver of
sulphur.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1010. <em>Striped Grass recommended for Hay.</em>&mdash;The Indian
striped or riband grass, which is cultivated in gardens, would
answer admirably for hay. In rich grounds plants are frequently
four feet high; what a burden of hay would a field so
cropped produce! Cattle are exceedingly fond of it; the seeds
are easily saved, so that a person might soon have enough for
a rood, and from that save again and again, for as many acres
as he might choose. It is probable that the crop might be
much too large to be made on the field where it grew; but
if so, it would be worth while to carry part into another field.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1011. <em>When to cut Rye-grass for Hay.</em>&mdash;Rye-grass, if mown
for hay, should be cut when in blossom, and not green. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
hay made from it does not heat or sweat so much, and is very
good for horses, but not for sheep and cattle. If it is suffered
to stand too long before it is cut, the seeds rob the plants of
their juices, and leave it no better than wheat or rye-straw.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1012. <em>To prevent the Smut in Wheat.</em>&mdash;The means (to prevent
smut) are simple; and no other than immersing the seed
in pure water, and repeatedly scouring it therein, just before it
is sown or dibbled in. Whether well, spring, or river water
be used, is indifferent; but repeated stirring and change of
water is essential to remove the possible particles of infection
that may have imperceptibly adhered to the seed; thus purified,
the subsequent crop will be perfect in itself, and seed successively
so likewise, if there be no adjacent fields from whence
this contamination may be wafted.</p>

<p>The addition of any alkaline or earthy salt, by increasing
the specific gravity of the water, is of advantage in floating off
the unsound grains, and after the seed is washed, it should be
dried immediately by rubbing it with newly slaked lime.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1013. <em>Fertilizing Steeps for Turnips, Wheat, or Barley.</em>&mdash;Steep
turnip-seed twelve hours in train oil, which strain through
a fine <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'seive'">sieve</span>, and immediately thoroughly mix the quantity of
seed you would wish to sow on an acre, with three bushels of
dry loamy earth, finely sifted, which drill (or sow) as soon as
possible; and when the plants begin to appear, throw a small
quantity of soot over them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1014. <em>Steep for Wheat, Barley, or other Grain.</em>&mdash;Put a peck
and a half of wood-ashes, and a peck of unslaked lime, into a
tub that will hold forty gallons; then add as much water as
will slake the lime, and render the mixture into the consistence
of stiff mortar. In this state it should remain ten or twelve
hours; then add as much water as will reduce the mortar to a
pulp, by thorough stirring. In this state fill the tub with water,
and occasionally keep stirring for two or three days. After
which, draw off the clear lye into an open vessel, and gradually
put the grain into it: skim off the light grains; and, after the
corn has been steeped three hours, spread it on a clean floor
to dry, when it will be sufficiently prepared for drilling or sowing.
The lye will retain its full virtue, and may be repeatedly
used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Remark.</em>&mdash;It has been doubted whether steeps are of any
use, except so far as they facilitate the separation of the light
grains, and wash off the seeds of the parasite plants, which are
thought to occasion <em>smut</em>, &amp;c. In the best-cultivated parts of
Scotland, seed-wheat is steeped in stale urine, or in a brine
made with common salt, which, by increasing the specific gravity
of the water, floats the unsound grains. The seed is well washed,
and then dried, by mixing it with fresh slaked lime, and
rubbing it briskly with a wooden shovel. The quick-lime and
rubbing is thought to assist in cleansing the seed; but, independent
of that, the mere drying the seed quickly is convenient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1015. <em>To sow Wheat to advantage, without laying on Manure.</em>&mdash;It
has been found expedient sometimes to sow wheat without
laying on any manure; and, in the beginning of February, to
collect twenty bushels of lime, unslaked, for every acre, and
forty bushels of sand, or the rubbish of a brick-kiln; then, about
the end of the month, to slake the lime, which doubles the
measure, and mix it well with the sand, and, immediately afterwards,
to scatter it by way of top-dressing over the green wheat.
As rain generally succeeds, it is soon washed down to the roots
of the plants, and gives them a vigor and strength, which, to
those who never made the experiment, is astonishing. The
lime, sand, and rubbish, are particularly useful in breaking the
tenacity of stiff clays. In a clay soil, where coal was very
cheap, the clay was slightly burned in the field, and spread
over the surface, as the cheapest way of subduing the coarseness
and stiffness of the soil. The refuse or rubbish from mines
in the neighborhood has been burned, and applied with advantage
on the same principle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1016. <em>Approved method of sowing Wheat on narrow ridges.</em>&mdash;The
seedsman should walk up one side of the bed and down
the other side, always keeping his face, and the hand with which
he sows, towards the bed he is sowing; his eye must be continually
on the edge of the opposite interfurrow, and deliver his
seed principally on the side of the bed next to it: as he returns,
the sides will of course be reversed, and the beds become evenly
seeded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1017. <em>Great utility of sowing Buckwheat.</em>&mdash;In light lands,
buckwheat may be raised to great advantage, as a lucrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
crop. When green, it is a fine feed for milch-kine; and when
ploughed, is a fine preparation for the land. It fattens pigs
with great economy, and, passed through the mill, is, with carrot,
a capital feed for work-horses. The seed is excellent food
for poultry, and, when ground, makes good bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1018. <em>To keep Crows from Corn.</em>&mdash;Take a quart of train oil,
and as much turpentine and bruised gunpowder; boil them together,
and, when hot, dip pieces of rags in the mixture, and
fix them on sticks in the field. About four are sufficient for an
acre of corn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1019. <em>Proper Soil for the Culture of Turnips.</em>&mdash;Sandy loams,
in good heart, are most favorable to their growth, though they
will thrive well on strong loams, if they are not wet; but, on
clayey, thin, or wet soils, they are not worth cultivating; for,
though a good crop may be raised on such ground, when well
prepared and dunged, more damage is done by taking off the
turnips in winter, in poaching the soil, than the value of the
crop will repay.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1020. <em>Instructions for raising Potatoes to advantage.</em>&mdash;The
earth should be dug twelve inches deep, if the soil will allow
it; after this, a hole should be opened about six inches deep,
and horse-dung, or long-litter, should be put therein, about three
inches thick; this hole should not be more than twelve inches
diameter. Upon this dung or litter, a potato should be planted
whole, upon which a little more dung should be shaken, and
then the earth must be put thereon. In like manner, the whole
plot of ground must be planted, taking care that the potatoes
be at least sixteen inches apart. When the young shoots make
their appearance, they should have fresh mould drawn round
them with a hoe; and if the tender shoots are covered, it will
prevent the frost from injuring them: they should again be
earthed when the shoots make a second appearance, but not
covered, as, in all probability, the season will be less severe.</p>

<p>A plentiful supply of mould should be given them; and the
person who performs this business should never tread upon the
plant, or the hillock that is raised round it, as the lighter the
earth is, the more room the potato will have to expand.</p>

<p>A gentleman obtained from a single root, thus planted, very
near forty pounds' weight of large potatoes; and, from almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
every other root upon the same plot of ground, from fifteen to
twenty pounds' weight; and, except the soil be stony or gravelly,
ten pounds, or half a peck, of potatoes, may almost be
obtained from each root, by pursuing the foregoing method.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1021. <em>Use of the Dandelion.</em>&mdash;This is an excellent salad, and
a good green. Where it grows as a weed, cover it early in the
spring, with rotten tan, or decayed leaves; it will soon
come up.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1022. <em>Preparations for Carrots and other winged Seeds.</em>&mdash;Take
two bushels of dry loamy earth, finely sifted; to which
add one bushel of bran, and a sufficient quantity of carrot seed,
cleaned from stalks, and well rubbed between the hands; all
which thoroughly mix together, and drill (or sow). The carrot
seed will stick to the bran, which, with the earth, will be
regularly discharged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1023. <em>To raise a Salad quickly.</em>&mdash;Steep lettuce-seed, mustard,
cresses, &amp;c., in aqua vitæ. Mix a little pigeon's dung with
some mould, and powdered <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'slacked'">slaked</span> lime. In forty-eight hours
the salad will be produced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1024. <em>Important Discovery relative to the Preservation of
Grain.</em>&mdash;To preserve rye and secure it from insects and rats,
nothing more is necessary than not to winnow it after it is
thrashed, but merely separate it from the straw, and to stow it
in the granaries, mixed with the chaff. In this state it has been
kept for more than three years without experiencing the
smallest alteration, and even without the necessity of being
turned to preserve it from humidity and fermentation. Rats
and mice may be prevented from entering the barn, by putting
some wild vine or hedge plants upon the heaps; the smell of
the wood is so offensive to these animals, that they will not
approach it. The experiment has not yet been made with
wheat and other kinds of grain, but they may probably be preserved
in the chaff with equal advantage. It must however be
observed, that the husks and corns of rye are different from
most other grain. It has been sown near houses where many
poultry were kept, for the purpose of bringing up a crop of
grass, because the poultry do not destroy it, as they would
have done wheat, oats, or even barley in the same situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1025. <em>To preserve Grain in Sacks.</em>&mdash;Provide a reed cane, or
other hollow stick, made so by gluing together two grooved
sticks; let it be about three feet nine inches long; and that it
may be easier thrust down to the bottom of the corn in the
sack, its end to be made to taper to a point, by a wooden plug
that is fixed in, and stops the orifice. About one hundred and
fifty small holes, of one-eighth of an inch in diameter, are to be
bored on all sides of the stick, from its bottom for about two
feet ten inches of its length; but no nearer to the surface of
the corn, lest too great a proportion of the air should escape
there. By winding a packthread in a spiral form round the
stick, the boring of the holes may be the better regulated, so as
to have them about half an inch distant towards the bottom,
but gradually at wider distances, so as to be an inch asunder at
the upper part; by which means the lower part of the corn
will have its due proportion of fresh air. To the top of the
stick let there be fixed a leathern pipe ten inches long; which
pipe is to be distended by two yards of spiral wire, coiled up
within it. At the upper part of the pipe is fixed a taper
wooden faucet, into which the nose of a common household bellows
is to be put, in order to ventilate the corn.</p>

<p>If wheat, when first put into sacks, be thus aired, every other
or third day, for ten or fifteen minutes, its damp sweats which
would hurt it, will, in a few weeks, be carried off to such a degree,
that it will afterwards keep sweet with very little airing,
as has been found by experience.</p>

<p>By the same means other kinds of seeds, as well as wheat,
may be kept sweet either in sacks or small bins.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1026. <em>To preserve Oats from being musty.</em>&mdash;Richard Fermor,
Esq. of Tusmore, in Oxfordshire, has in his stable a contrivance
to let oats down from a loft out of a vessel, like the
hopper of a mill, whence they fall into a square pipe, let into a
wall, about four inches diagonal, which comes into a cupboard
set into a wall, but with its end so near the bottom, that there
shall never be above a desirable quantity in the <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'cup-board'">cupboard</span> at a
time, which being taken away, another parcel succeeds; by this
motion the oats are kept constantly sweet (the taking away
one gallon moving the whole above), which, when laid up
otherwise in great quantities, frequently grow musty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1027. <em>Easy Method of destroying Mites or Weevils in Granaries.</em>&mdash;A
very sagacious farmer has succeeded in destroying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
weevils, by a very easy process. In the month of June, when
his granaries were all empty, he collected great quantities of
the largest sized ants, and scattered them about the places infested
with the weevils. The ants immediately fell upon and
devoured every one of them; nor have any weevils since that
time been seen on his premises.</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em>&mdash;The large, or wood-ant, feeds entirely on animal
substances; of course it would not destroy the corn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1028. <em>To preserve Carrots, Parsnips, and Beets, all the Winter.</em>&mdash;A
little before the frost sets in, draw your beets or parsnips
out of the ground, and lay them in the house, burying
their roots in sand to the neck of the plant, and ranging
them one by another in a shelving position; then another
bed of sand, and another of beets, and continue this order
to the last. By pursuing this method, they will keep very
fresh. When they are wanted for use, draw them, as they
stand, not out of the middle or sides.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1029. <em>To preserve Turnips from Frost.</em>&mdash;The best way is to
stack them up in straw in the following manner:&mdash;One load of
any sort of dry straw is sufficient for an acre of fifty tons'
weight. Pull up the turnips, top and tail them, then throw
them in a sort of windrow, and let them lie a few days to dry.</p>

<p>First, lay a layer of straw next the ground, and upon it a
layer of turnips about half a yard thick; then another layer of
straw; so go on alternately with a layer of straw and a layer
of turnips; every layer grows narrower, till it comes to a
point at the top, like a sugar-loaf. The last layer must be
straw, which serves to keep all dry. You must observe
always when you have laid a layer of turnips, to stroke or
lap over the ends of the under layer of straw, in order to
keep them close or from tumbling out. The heap should be as
large as a hay-cock; the tops may be given to sheep or cattle
as they are cut off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1030. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Turnips placed in layers, though not thick,
have been found, after a few weeks, to rot. In some places
the following method is adopted. Lay the turnips close
together in a single layer, on a grass field, near the farmyard,
and scatter some straw and branches of trees over them;
this will preserve them from sudden alternations of frost and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
thaw. They keep as well as stored turnips can do. The bare
grass is of no value in winter, and may rather perhaps receive
some benefit from the shelter of the turnip. An immense
quantity may thus be stored on a small extent of grass ground.
It is chiefly useful for small farmers, in soils unfit for the turnip,
but who are forced to raise it for milk-cows, or to support,
in the winter, the sheep they feed in the summer on the commons,
and which they keep, perhaps, principally in the night,
on the fields they have no other means of manuring. But it
may be useful, even on proper turnip soils, to save the latter
part of the crop from the sudden frosts and sunshine in the
spring, or in an open winter, which rot so great a portion of it;
perhaps a fourth or third part of what is then on the ground.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1031. <em>The good effects of Elder in preserving Plants from
Insects and Flies.</em>&mdash;1. For preventing cabbage and cauliflower
plants from being devoured and damaged by caterpillars. 2.
For preventing blights, and their effects on fruit-trees. 3. For
preserving corn from yellow flies and other insects. 4. For
securing turnips from the ravages of flies. The dwarf elder appears
to exhale a much more fetid smell than the common
elder, and therefore should be preferred.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1032. <em>The use of Sulphur in destroying Insects on Plants,
and its Benefit for Vegetation.</em>&mdash;Tie up some flower of sulphur
in a piece of muslin or fine linen, and with this the leaves of
young shoots of plants should be dusted; or it may be thrown
on them by means of a common swans'-down puff, or even by a
dredging-box.</p>

<p>Fresh assurances have repeatedly been received of the powerful
influence of sulphur against the whole tribe of insects and
worms which infest and prey on vegetables. Sulphur has also
been found to promote the health of plants, on which it was
sprinkled; and that peach-trees, in particular, were remarkably
improved by it, and seemed to absorb it. It has likewise been
observed, that the verdure, and other healthful appearances,
were perceptibly increased; for the quantity of new shoots and
leaves formed subsequently to the operation, and having no
sulphur on their surfaces, served as a kind of comparative
index, and pointed out distinctly the accumulation of health.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1033. <em>Method of stopping the Ravages of the Caterpillars from
Shrubs, Plants, and Vegetables.</em>&mdash;Take a chafing-dish, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
lighted charcoal, and place it under the branches of the tree,
or bush, whereon are the caterpillars; then throw a little brimstone
on the coals. The vapor of the sulphur, which is mortal
to these insects, and the suffocating fixed air arising from the
charcoal, will not only destroy all that are on the tree, but will
effectually prevent the shrubs from being, that season, infested
with them. A pound of sulphur will clear as many trees as
grow on several acres.</p>

<p>Another method of driving these insects off fruit-trees, is to
boil together a quantity of rue, wormwood, and common tobacco
(of each equal parts), in common water. The liquor
should be very strong. Sprinkle this on the leaves and young
branches every morning and evening during the time the fruit
is ripening.</p>

<p>In the Economical Journal of France, the following method
of guarding cabbages from the depredations of caterpillars is
stated to be infallible, and may, perhaps, be equally serviceable
against those which infest other vegetables. Sow with
hemp all the borders of the ground wherein the cabbage is
planted; and, although the neighborhood be infested with caterpillars,
the space inclosed by the hemp will be perfectly free,
and not one of these vermin will approach it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1034. <em>To prevent the Increase of Pismires in Grass Lands
newly laid down.</em>&mdash;Make a strong decoction of walnut-tree
leaves, and after opening several of the pismires' sandy habitations,
pour upon them a quantity of the liquor, just sufficient to
fill the hollow of each heap: after the middle of it has been
scooped, throw in the contents from the sides, and press down
the whole mass with the foot, till it becomes level with the
rest of the field. This, if not found effectual at first, must be
repeated a second or a third time, when they infallibly will be
destroyed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1035. <em>To prevent the Fly in Turnips.</em>&mdash;From experiments
lately made, it has been ascertained that lime sown by hand,
or distributed by a machine, is an infallible protection to turnips
against the ravages of this destructive insect. It should be
applied as soon as the turnips come up, and in the same daily
rotation in which they were sown. The lime should be <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'slacked'">slaked</span>
immediately before it is used, if the air be not sufficiently moist
to render that operation unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1036. <em>To prevent Mice from destroying early sown Peas.</em>&mdash;The
tops of furze, or whins, chopped and thrown into the drills,
and thus covered up, (by goading them in their attempt to
scratch,) is an effectual preventive. Sea-sand, <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'stewed'">strewn</span> pretty
thick upon the surface, has the same effect. It gets into their
ears, and is troublesome.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1037. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;In the gardens in Devonshire, a simple
trap is used to destroy mice. A common brick, or flat stone,
is set on one end, inclined at an angle of about forty-five degrees.
Two strings, tied to a cracked stick, stuck in the ground,
with loops at the ends of the strings, are brought round to the
middle of the under part of the brick, and one loop being put
into the other, a pea or bean, or any other bait, makes the
string fast, so as to support the brick. When the animal removes
the bait, the loops separate, and the brick, by falling,
smothers the animal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1038. <em>To Destroy Beetles.</em>&mdash;Take some small lumps of unslaked
lime, and put into the chinks or holes from which they
issue, it will effectually destroy them; or it may be scattered
on the ground, if they are more numerous than in their holes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1039. <em>Another Method.</em>&mdash;The simplest and most effectual
way of destroying beetles is by means of red wafers. As it
has become usual to substitute vermilion for red lead in the
composition of wafers, it will be necessary to ask particularly
for such as have been made with red lead. Strew these in the
neighborhood of the crevices from which these insects issue,
and their future incursions will be speedily prevented. Cockroaches
may be destroyed by the same means.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1040. <em>For Destroying Bugs and Worms in Wood.</em>&mdash;An eminent
physician has discovered that by rubbing wood with a
solution of vitriol, insects and bugs are prevented from harboring
therein. When the strength of this remedy is required to
be increased, there need only be boiled some coloquintida
apples in water, in which, afterwards, vitriol is dissolved, and
the bedstead, with the wood about them, and the wainscoting,
being anointed with the liquor, will be ever after clear of
worms or bugs. The wall may be likewise rubbed with the
composition, and some of it may be dropped into the holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
where these insects are suspected to be harbored. As to the
walls, they require only to be washed over with the vitriol
water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1041. <em>To Destroy Insects on Wall Fruit Trees.</em>&mdash;Take an old
tin watering-pan, or any similar vessel, and make a charcoal
fire in it; add a tube or pipe, made of either tin, leather, or
stiff paper, to the spout, which may be of any sufficient length;
then strew some brimstone, tobacco-dust, fine shreds of leather,
&amp;c., upon the fire, in the pan, and cover the top; having a pair
of bellows ready, hold the wind-flap over the tube or pipe to
receive the smoke, which it will do very effectually when you
use the bellows. By this means the suffocating vapor may be
directed through the bellows to any part of the tree with the
greatest ease and facility, and the tree soon cleared of all
vermin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1042. <em>To Destroy the Insect which attacks the Apple Tree,
commonly called the White Blight, or American Blight.</em>&mdash;To a
strong decoction of the digitalis or foxglove, add a sufficient
quantity of fresh cow-dung, to give it such a consistence as may
enable you to apply it with a painters' brush to those parts of
the bark of the tree, which afford a harbor for this destructive
insect. The insect is generally destroyed by the first application,
though in some instances it may be necessary to repeat it.
It has been remarked that the insect never returns in future
years to those parts of the tree which have been thus treated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1043. <em>For Destroying Caterpillars on Gooseberry Bushes.</em>&mdash;Take
one Scots pint (two English quarts) of tobacco liquor
(which may be made, where it cannot be purchased, by infusing
any kind of tobacco in water till all the strength be extracted)
which the manufacturers of tobacco generally sell for
destroying bugs, and mix them with about one ounce of alum;
and when the alum is sufficiently dissolved, put this mixture
into a plate, or other vessel, wide and long enough to admit of
a brush, like a weaver's brush, being dipped into it; and as
early in the season as you can perceive the leaves of the bushes
to be in the least eaten, or the eggs upon the leaves (which
generally happens about the end of May), and which will be
found in great numbers on the veins of the leaves on their
under side; you are then to take the preparation, or liquor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and after dipping the brush into it, and holding the brush towards
the under side of the bush, which is to be raised and supported
by the hands of another person; and by drawing your
hand gently over the hairs of the brush, the above liquid is
sprinkled, and falls in small drops on the leaves; the consequence
of which is, if the eggs are there, they never come forward;
and if they have already generated worms, in a minute
or two after the liquor touches them, they either die or sicken,
so as to fall off the bush; at least they do so upon giving it a
little shake. If, upon their thus falling off, they shall not appear
completely dead, the bush should be held up, and either
a little boiling water from a watering-pot thrown over them, or
a bruise given them by a spade or shovel; or the earth, where
they lie, turned over with a hoe. This preparation does not in
the least injure the bushes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1044. <em>To Preserve Flowers, Leaves, and Fruit, from Caterpillars.</em>&mdash;These
depredators are destroyed by oils, which close
the lateral pores by which they breathe. For this purpose it is
advised, that on the approach of spring, a cloth, dipped in train
oil, be laid on such parts of the tree in which there is the least
appearance of them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1045. <em>Method to destroy or drive away Earth Worms, and
other Insects, hurtful to Fields and Gardens.</em>&mdash;Three parts of
quick-lime, newly made, and two parts of soap-boilers' ley or
potash dissolved in water, will produce a somewhat milky liquor
sufficiently caustic, and highly hostile and poisonous to earth-worms
and other small animals; for as soon as it touches any
part of their bodies, it occasions in them violent symptoms of
great uneasiness. If this liquor be poured into those holes, in
which the earth-worms reside under ground, they immediately
throw themselves out as if driven by some force, and, after
various contortions, languish and die. If the leaves of plants or
fruit-trees, frequented by the voracious caterpillars, which are
so destructive to them, be sprinkled over with this liquor,
these insects suddenly contract their bodies and drop to the
ground. For, though nature has defended them tolerably well
by their hairy skins, from any thing that might injure their delicate
bodies; yet, as soon as they touch with their feet or mouths
the leaves which have been moistened by this liquor, they become,
as it were, stupefied, instantly contract themselves, and
fall down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1046. <em>To destroy Earwigs and Wood Lice.</em>&mdash;A very simple
way of ensnaring them, and by which they may be taken alive
in great quantities, is to place four inch-cuts of reeds, bean-haulm,
or strong wheat-straw among the branches, and also lay
a number on the ground, at the bottom of the wall. In these
the insects take refuge at day-break, as they depredate chiefly in
the night; and any time through the day they may be blown
into a bottle with a little water in it, and so be drowned. Or,
a cheaper way is to burn the straw, and scatter fresh on the
ground.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1047. <em>To destroy Fleas on Dogs.</em>&mdash;Rub the animal, when
out of the house, with the common Scotch snuff, except the nose
and eyes. Rub the powder well into the roots of the hair.
Clear lime-water destroys the whitish flea-worm without injuring
the skin or hair. Oil of turpentine will likewise do so; but if
there be any manginess, or the skin be broken, it will give the
animal much pain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1048. <em>To clear Gardens of Vermin, by Ducks.</em>&mdash;Ducks are
excellent vermin-pickers, whether of caterpillars (such as are
within their reach), slugs, snails, and others, and ought to be
turned into the garden one or two days every week throughout
the season. Never keep them longer in than two or three
hours at a time, else they become indolent. While here, they
should have a little water set down to them, if there be no pond
or stream in the garden.</p>

<p>Never turn them into the garden in the time of heavy rains,
or in continued wet weather, as in that case, and particularly
if the soil be stiff, they patter and harden the surface, to the
great injury of small crops and rising seeds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1049. <em>The use of Garlic against Moles, Grubs, and Snails.</em>&mdash;Moles
are such enemies to the smell of garlic, that, in order to
get rid of these troublesome and destructive guests, it is sufficient
to introduce a few heads of garlic into their subterraneous
walks. It is likewise employed with success against grubs and
snails.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1050. <em>To prevent the destruction of Field Turnips by Slugs.</em>&mdash;A
few years since, a considerable farmer, near Bath, observing
the turnips in one of his fields strongly attacked by something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
discovered, by accident, that the enemy was really a slug; and
immediately prevented farther damage by well rolling the whole
field, by night, which killed all the slugs.</p>

<p>N. B. This was the grand secret which was advertised for
two thousand subscribers, at one guinea each, by W. Vagg,
<em>for destroying the fly</em> in turnips&mdash;which it will <em>not</em> do!</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1051. <em>Method of destroying Insects on Fruit Trees.</em>&mdash;Make
a strong decoction of tobacco, and the tender shoots of elder,
by pouring boiling water on them; then sprinkle your trees
with the same (cold) twice a week, for two or three weeks,
with a small hearth-brush, which will effectually destroy the
insects, and the leaves will retain their verdure until the fall
of the year.</p>

<p>If used early, as soon as the bud unfolds itself, it will probably
prevent the fly. The effect of tobacco has been long known,
and elder-water frequently sprinkled on honeysuckles and roses,
has been found to prevent insects from lodging on them.</p>

<p>The quantity to be made use of, is one ounce of tobacco to
one gallon of water, with about two handfuls of elder. You
may, however, make it as strong as you please, it being perfectly
innocent to the plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1052. <em>To destroy Insects prejudicial to Apple-Trees.</em>&mdash;To one
hundred gallons of human urine, and one bushel of lime, add
cow-dung to bring it to the consistence of paint. With this
composition anoint the trees. The month of March is the proper
season for applying it. If the white efflorescence-like substance
in which the insects are lodged, has made its appearance,
it should previously be brushed off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1053. <em>To destroy wasps on Fruit-Trees.</em>&mdash;Wasps, about the
month of July, will begin to swarm about the early fruits; and
for their destruction, phials should be hung about the branches,
half-filled with honey and water, or with sugar and small-beer.
These should be emptied and replaced once in two or three
days, otherwise they do not take so well&mdash;these little animals
being extremely sagacious, and disliking the appearance of their
own species, when dead.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1054. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Winter is the proper season to apply the
following solution. The juices are then determined to the root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Soft soap, two pounds; leaf or roll tobacco, one pound;
nux-vomica, two ounces; and turpentine, half an English gill:
boil them in eight English gallons of soft or river water, to six;
and use it milk-warm.</p>

<p>Unnail or untie all the branches from the wall or trellis;
brush every part of the tree clean with a soft brush, such as is
used for painting; then, with a sponge, carefully anoint every
branch, root, and bud; and be <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'sure rub'">sure to rub</span> it well into every joint,
hole, and angle, as it is there the eggs or larvæ of the insects
are chiefly lodged. The rails, spars, &amp;c., of the espalier or
trellis, should also be anointed as above.</p>

<p>This operation should be repeated every winter, some time
between the fall of the leaf and the first of February, as may
be most convenient. The solution is effectually destructive to
all kinds of insects, their eggs or larvæ.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1055. <em>To kill Reptiles.</em>&mdash;Twelve ounces of quick-lime in
powder, two ounces of Scotch snuff, two ounces of basket salt,
two ounces of sulphur vivum, dissolved in ten gallons of water,
and thrown on the insects, either in the liquid or powder, will
destroy them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1056. <em>To prevent Slugs from getting into Fruit-Trees.</em>&mdash;If the
trees are standards, tie a coarse horse-hair rope about them,
two or three feet from the ground. If they are against the wall,
nail a narrow slip of coarse horse-hair cloth against the wall,
about half a foot from the ground, and they will never get over
it; for if they attempt it, it will kill them, as their bellies are
soft, and the horse-hair will wound them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1057. <em>To destroy Snails.</em>&mdash;Snails are great enemies to wall-fruit;
and any dewy morning you may easily find where they
most delight to breed; but the best way is to find out their
haunts in a hard winter, and then destroy them: they lie much
in holes of walls, under thorns, behind old trees or old and close
hedges. If you pluck not the fruit they have begun to devour,
but let it alone, they will finish their repast on this, before they
begin another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1058. <em>To destroy the Red Spider, so troublesome in dry seasons.</em>&mdash;The
red spider makes its appearance in hot, dry weather,
and is always found on the under sides of the leaves, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
on roughish leaves, but not always so. It preys on the apple,
cherry, fig, peach, pear, and plum&mdash;seldom on the apricot. It
is among the smallest of the acari, and is sometimes not distinguishable
without a microscope. If the <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'bark'">back</span> of the leaf be
viewed through one, it appears full of its webs; and if many
abound on it, the leaf appears full of punctures, becomes discolored,
and brown on the upper surface, fades, and falls off.</p>

<p>This insect is more troublesome in dry seasons than in moist
ones, and is wonderfully encouraged by heat&mdash;insomuch, that
hot-houses of every description are sadly infested with it. Water,
and water only, is its bane; and the syringe, or the force-pump,
the engine of its destruction. It is not a mere sprinkling
that will do; it requires a forcible dashing to and fro, and that
often repeated, to be effectual.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1059. <em>To destroy Vermin in Granaries and other Outbuildings.</em>&mdash;Cover
completely the walls and rafters, above and below,
of the granaries, &amp;c., which are infested with weevils and other
vermin, with quick-lime slaked in water, in which trefoil, wormwood,
and hyssop have been boiled. This composition ought
to be applied as hot as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1060. <em>To destroy Worms in Gardens.</em>&mdash;Water your beds
with a strong decoction of walnut-tree leaves where there are
worm casts; the worms will immediately rise up out of the
earth, and you may easily take and cut them to pieces, and fatten
your poultry therewith, or feed fish in ponds with them.</p>

<p>By laying ashes or lime about any plant, neither snails nor
worms will come near it. As the moisture weakens it, you
must, more or less, continue to renew the lime or ashes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1061. <em>To destroy Worms in Gravel Walks, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Pour into
the holes a ley, made of wood ashes and lime; this will also
destroy insects, if trees are sprinkled with it. Salt and water
will do as well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1062. <em>Usefulness of the Wren in destroying Insects.</em>&mdash;As a
devourer of pernicious insects, one of the most useful birds is
the house wren. This little bird seems to be particularly fond
of the society of man, and it must be confessed that it is often
protected by his interested care. It has long been a custom, in
many parts of the country, to fix a small box at the end of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
long pole, in gardens, about houses, &amp;c., as a place for it to
build in. In these boxes they build and hatch their young.
When the young are hatched, the parent bird feeds them with
a variety of different insects, particularly such as are injurious
in gardens. An intelligent gentleman was at the trouble to
observe the number of times a pair of these birds came from
their box, and returned with insects for their young. He found
that they did this from 40 to 60 times in an hour, and in one
particular hour, the birds carried food to their young 71 times.
In this business they were engaged the greater part of the day;
say 12 hours. Taking the medium therefore of 50 times in an
hour, it appeared that a single pair of these birds took from the
cabbage, salad, beans, peas, and other vegetables in the garden,
at least 600 insects in the course of one day. This calculation
proceeds upon the supposition that the two birds took
only a single insect each time. But it is highly probable they
often took several at a time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1063. <em>To destroy Rats and other Vermin.</em>&mdash;Sponge, if cut in
small pieces, fried or dipped in honey, and given to vermin,
distends their intestines, and effectually destroys them. The
addition of a little oil of Rhodium will tempt them to eat.</p>

<p>A better method would be to feed them regularly two or
three weeks in any apartment which they infest. The hole, by
which they enter, being first fitted with a sliding door, to
which a long string may be added; any apartment might thus
be turned into a gigantic rat-trap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1064. <em>Another Method of Destroying Rats.</em>&mdash;Lay bird-lime
in their haunts, for though they are nasty enough in other respects,
yet being very curious of their <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'fir'">fur</span>, if it is but daubed
with this stuff, it is so troublesome to them that they will even
scratch their skins from off their own backs to get it off, and
will never abide in a place where they have suffered in this
manner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1065. <em>To destroy Rats or Mice.</em>&mdash;Mix flour of malt with
some butter; add thereto a drop or two of oil of anise-seeds;
make it up into balls, and bait your traps therewith. <em>If you
have thousands</em>, by this means you may take them all.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1066. <em>A Mouse Trap, by which forty or fifty Mice may be
caught in a Night.</em>&mdash;Take a plain four-square trencher, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
into the two contrary ends of it a large pin, or piece of thick
knitting-needle; then take two sticks about a yard long, and
lay them on your dresser, with a notch cut at each end of your
sticks, placing the two pins, stuck on the corner of the trencher,
on the notches of the two sticks, so that one corner of your
trencher may lie about an inch upon your dresser or place that
the mice may come to; then let the corner that lies opposite
to this be baited with some butter and oatmeal, plastered fast
on, and when the mice run off the dresser to the butter, it will
tip them into a vessel full of water, which you must place under
the trencher, in which they will be drowned.</p>

<p>That your trencher may not tip over, with a little sealing-wax
and a thread seal the string to the dresser and trencher,
and it will remain in good order for weeks or months.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1067. <em>New, simple, and effectual Method of destroying Rats.</em>&mdash;A
few years ago, the corn-mill at Glossop was very much
infested with rats. A quantity of barley, which lay on the
chamber floor was hourly visited by some of them. The miller
one day going to drive them away as usual, happened to catch
one of them under his hat, which he killed; he then singed all
the hair off its body, &amp;c., until its skin, tail, and legs, became
stiff by the operation. In this condition he set it upon its feet
by the side of a heap of barley, where it stood, with pricked-up
ears and tail, for some time; after this, no rat dared to
come near it; and in a short space of time the mill was cleared
of those depredators, and has continued so ever since.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1068. <em>To prevent the Burrowing of Rats in Houses.</em>&mdash;Rats
may be effectually prevented from burrowing under the foundation
of houses, by making an offset of stone or brick, about
two feet in breadth, and eighteen inches below the surface; and
by carrying up a perpendicular wall from the edge of this offset,
to within a few inches of the ground. The adoption of the
same plan <em>inside</em> will prevent the burrowing of these animals in
cellars; for rats always burrow close to a wall; and finding
their perpendicular course impeded, they take a horizontal direction,
as far as the offset continues, when they are again
stopped by the outside wall. Thus baffled, they ascend, and
go off.</p>

<p>Those persons who have suffered in their granaries, ice-houses,
and in the cellars of their dwelling-houses, by the depredations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of rats, will probably deem this one of the most valuable
articles of the present work.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1069. <em>To keep Ponds and Artificial Pieces of Water free from
Weeds.</em>&mdash;At the Marquis of Exeter's seat, near Burghley, there
is an artificial piece of water, about a mile in length, which
used to be so over-run with weeds, that three men were employed
constantly, for six months in every year, to keep them
under; in which they never perfectly succeeded. About seven
years ago, two pair of swans were put on the water: they completely
cleared away all the weeds the first year, and none have
appeared since, as the swans constantly eat them before they
rise to the surface.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1070. <em>Usefulness of Mowing Weeds.</em>&mdash;In the month of June
weeds are in their most succulent state; and in this state, especially
after they have lain a few hours to wither, hungry cattle
will eat greedily almost every species. There is scarcely a
hedge, border, or nook, but at this season is valuable, and it
must certainly be good management to embrace the transient
opportunity; for in a few weeks they will become nuisances.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1071. <em>On the great Increase of Milk from feeding Milch Cows
with Sainfoin.</em>&mdash;The quantity of milk produced by cows fed by
sainfoin is nearly double to that of any other food. The milk
is also much richer, and will yield a larger quantity of cream.
The butter will also be better colored and flavored than any
other.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1072. <em>Parsnips productive of Milk in Cows.</em>&mdash;Parsnips cause
cows to produce abundance of milk, and they eat them as free
as they do oil-cake. Land, 7<em>l</em>. an acre in Guernsey, is sown
with parsnips to feed cattle, and the milk is like cream.&mdash;Sheep,
when lambing, fed with them, produce much milk. They are
improper food for horses, subjecting them to blindness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1073. <em>Most proper Food for Milch Cows.</em>&mdash;Milch cows are infinitely
more profitable kept in the house than out of doors,
but they must be trained to it, otherwise they do not thrive.</p>

<p>The best food for them are clover, lucern, potatoes, yams,
turnips, carrots, cabbages, peas, and beans.</p>

<p>Such cows as those in the neighborhood of London, kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the house, and properly fed, ought to yield nine gallons per day,
for the first four months after calving.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1074. <em>Additional Quantity of Milk to be gained by keeping
Milch Cows in the House.</em>&mdash;In the management of cows a warm
stable is highly necessary; and currying them like horses not
only affords them pleasure, but makes them give their milk
more freely. They ought always to be kept clean, laid dry,
and have plenty of good sweet water to drink. Cows treated
in this manner have given two gallons of milk at a time, when
within ten days of calving.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1075. <em>Utility of Carrots as Food for Horses and other stall
Beasts.</em>&mdash;Carrots are excellent food for horses, either given
alone, or along with hay, likewise for fattening stall beasts.
They make them eat straw, and very indifferent hay, greedily.
If the same be given to cows, the milk will have a much less
offensive taste and smell than when they are fed on turnips.</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em>&mdash;It must be noted, however, that carrots, though
very excellent, are a very expensive food. They would not
enable a farmer to pay his rent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1076. <em>Excellent Method of rearing Calves, and of preserving
the Cream, and a great Part of the Milk during that Time.</em>&mdash;Put
some water on the fire, nearly the quantity that the calf
can drink. When it boils, throw into it one or two handfuls
of oatmeal, and suffer the whole to boil for a minute. Then
leave it to cool until new-milk-warm. Then mix with it one
or two quarts of milk, that has stood twelve hours, and has
been skimmed: stir the whole, and give it the calf to drink.
At first it is necessary to make the calf drink by presenting the
fingers to it, but it soon learns to do without this help, and will
grow incomparably faster than by the old method. This new
method is not only a theoretical truth, but its success is confirmed
by experience.</p>

<p>The economical advantages resulting from it are as follows.
According to the old method, a calf intended for slaughter is
made to suck for three weeks, and those intended for agriculture,
from six to eight weeks. Supposing the cow gives only a
moderate quantity of milk, the value of it will amount, in
three weeks, to nearly the value of the calf. If, on the contrary,
we rear a calf according to this method, we consume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
during the three weeks only three quarts of oatmeal, at most,
and the skimmed milk.</p>

<p>Calves that have been brought up by this method have been
always healthy and strong, and not subject to disease. They
are not suffered to suck at all, but to have the pure milk of the
mother to drink for the first four days, because it has been observed,
that the separation, after four days, is more painful to
the mother than when the calf is taken from her soon after its
birth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1077. <em>Rules for Milking Cows.</em>&mdash;Cows should be milked
three times a day, if fully fed throughout the summer, and
great caution should be exercised by the persons employed, to
draw the milk from them completely, not only to increase the
quantity of produce, but to preserve its quality. Any portion
which may be left in the udder seems gradually absorbed in
the system, and no more is formed than enough to supply the
loss of what is taken away, and by the continuance of the same
mode, a yet farther diminution of the secretion takes place, till
at length scarcely any is produced. This last method of milking
is always practised, when it is intended that a cow should
be rendered dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1078. <em>Proper Temperature for a Dairy.</em>&mdash;The apartments
appropriated for dairy purposes should, if possible, possess a
moderate temperature throughout the year, and should be kept
perfectly clean and dry. The temperature of about fifty-five
degrees is most favorable for the separation of the cream from
the milk. The utensils of the dairy are best made of wood;
lead and copper are soluble in acid, and highly pernicious; and
though iron is not injurious, the taste of it might render the
produce of the dairy unpalatable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1079. <em>Method of making excellent Butter from the Milk of
Cows fed upon Turnips.</em>&mdash;Let the bowls, either lead or wood,
be kept constantly clean, and well scalded with boiling water,
before using. When the milk is brought into the dairy, to
every eight quarts mix one quart of boiling water; then put
up the milk into the bowls to stand for cream. By keeping
strictly to this method, you will have, during the winter, constantly
sweet and well-tasted butter from the milk of cows fed
upon turnips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1080. <em>Improved Method of making Butter.</em>&mdash;If the dairy consists
of three or four cows, they should be milked in the summer
thrice a day; in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.
Each milking must be kept by itself, in flat wooden vessels, to
cool in like manner; and thus in succession for two or three
days, according to the temperature of the air, the milk thickens,
and thence is fit for churning, soonest in the warmest
weather. The quantity of butter will be generally in the proportion
of a pound (twenty-two ounces) for each ten pints, or
five English gallons of milk. In winter, the cows are to be
milked only twice a day, and the milk is to be put into the
churn warm from the cow, where it must stand a day or two
longer than in summer before it becomes sufficiently thick;
although to promote the coagulation, it is sometimes brought
near the kitchen fire, particularly on the preceding night before
it is churned; and, in intense cold, it will be necessary to add
a small quantity of boiling water. The operation of churning
is performed with the plunge-churn, from two to three hours,
for thirty or forty pints of milk; and at the last stage of the
process, a little cold water thrown in has the effect of promoting
the separation of the butter from the milk. This method
of making butter has long been practiced in England; it
may be worth trial in America.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The dairy-maid must not be disheartened if she does
not succeed perfectly in her first attempt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1081. <em>To prevent Cows from contracting bad Habits while
Milking.</em>&mdash;Cows should always be treated with great gentleness,
and soothed by mild usage, especially when young and ticklish,
or when the paps are tender, in which case the udder ought to
be fomented with warm water, before milking, and touched
with the greatest gentleness, otherwise the cow will be in
danger of contracting bad habits, becoming stubborn and unruly,
and retaining her milk ever after. A cow never lets
down her milk pleasantly to the person she dreads or dislikes.
The udder and paps should always be washed with clean water
before milking; but care should be taken that none of that
water be admitted into the milking pail.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1082. <em>To mark Sheep, without injury to the Wool.</em>&mdash;To thirty
spoonfuls of linseed oil, add two ounces of litharge and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
ounce of lamp-black: unite them together by boiling, and mark
the sheep therewith.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1083. <em>To improve the Wool of Sheep, by Smearing.</em>&mdash;Immediately
after the sheep are shorn, soak the roots of the wool
that remain all over with oil or butter and brimstone; and
three or four days afterwards, wash them with salt and water.
The wool of next season will not only be much finer, but the
quantity will be in greater abundance. It may be depended
upon, that the sheep will not be troubled with the scab or
vermin that year. Salt water is a safe and effectual remedy
against maggots.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1084. <em>To preserve Cattle from Disease in the Winter.</em>&mdash;When
cattle are kept out in the winter, it is recommended as an useful
practice to rub some tar at the root of the horn, which prevents
the wet from getting between the root and the skin, and,
it is said, contributes to preserve the health of the animal, and
to keep it free from various diseases to which it may otherwise
be liable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1085. <em>How to Promote the Health of Farm Animals.</em>&mdash;All
domestic animals should be abundantly furnished with salt. A
supply kept within their reach, whenever it can be done, is recommended.
Horses and pigs should occasionally have ashes
given them in their food; and pigs ought at all times, when
confined in pens, to be supplied with charcoal, as, besides being
a medicine, it is a cheap and valuable food.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1086. <em>Parsley recommended to Farmers to be sown with Rape-seed,
as a preservative against the Resp in Sheep.</em>&mdash;A correspondent
of the "Chester Chronicle" recommends to all farmers
who sow rape-seed, to sow with it a small portion of parsley
at the same time; this he pronounces an infallible preservative
against the malady well-known by the name of <em>resp</em>, in sheep:
he also advises to sow parsley on turnip land at the time of
hoeing turnips. The above correspondent asserts, that he has
pursued this plan upwards of twenty-five years, and during that
time he has never lost one sheep, either in rape or turnip land.</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em>&mdash;In some counties, parsley is sown with clover, on
the supposition that it prevents cattle from being bursten, or
hoven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1087. <em>How to catch Sheep.</em>&mdash;Never seize them by the wool
on the back; it hurts them exceedingly, and, in some cases,
has been known to kill them, particularly in hot weather, when
they are large and fat. The best way is to avoid the wool altogether;
accustom yourself to take them by the hind leg, or
what is still better, by the neck, placing one hand under the
jaws, and the other at the back of the ears. By lifting up the
head, in this manner, a child may hold almost any sheep, without
danger to the animal or himself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1088. <em>Mr. Bakewell's Liquid for the cure of the <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'Foot-ret'">Foot-rot</span> in
Sheep.</em>&mdash;Dissolve four ounces, each, of vitriol and common
alum, three ounces of verdigris, an ounce and a half of white
mercury, and an ounce of white copperas, all finely pulverized,
in a quart of white-wine vinegar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1089. <em>Mr. Culley's Red Salve, to cure the Rot in Sheep.</em>&mdash;Mix
four ounces of the best honey, two ounces of burnt alum,
reduced to powder, and half a pound of Armenian bole, with
as much train or fish oil as will convert these ingredients into
the consistence of a salve. The honey must first be gradually
dissolved, when the Armenian bole must be stirred in; afterwards
the alum and train oil are to be added.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1090. <em>A profitable way of fattening Pigs.</em>&mdash;Put four pigs in
a sty, for they feed best in company; but if there are too many,
they are apt to quarrel: feed them moderately the first week;
and thrice during the second week, mix with their barley-meal
as much antimony as will lie on a shilling; and the third week,
twice give them the same quantity. I need scarcely observe,
it is in powder.</p>

<p>This purifies the blood, gives them an appetite, and makes
them thrive apace.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1091. <em>New mode of fattening Pigs.</em>&mdash;A pig lately gained, by
feeding on Indian corn, in the course of six weeks and three
days, the enormous weight of fifteen stone. This mode of feeding
has long been known to the Neapolitans, whose pigs are so
fat, as hardly to be able to move.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>GARDENING.</h4>

<p>1092. <em>Proper situation for a Green-House.</em>&mdash;The aspect of a
green-house may be at any point from east to west, following
the course of the sun; or, it may even be a little to the north
of east or west; but only a little, and the less the better, otherwise
the plants will not generally thrive in it, nor will the
flowers acquire their natural colors. A south aspect is to be
preferred.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1093. <em>On preserving Seeds of Plants in a state fit for Vegetation.</em>&mdash;Seeds
of plants may be preserved, for many months
at least, by causing them to be packed, either in husks, pods,
&amp;c., in absorbent paper, with raisins or brown moist sugar;
or, a good way, practised by gardeners, is to wrap the seed in
brown paper or cartridge paper, pasted down, and then varnished
over.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1094. <em>To facilitate the Growth of Foreign Seeds.</em>&mdash;Mr. Humboldt
has found, that seeds which do not commonly germinate
in our climate, or in our hot-houses, and which, of course, we
cannot raise for our gardens, or hope to naturalize in our fields,
become capable of germinating, when immersed for some days
in a weak, oxygenized muriatic acid. This interesting discovery
has already turned to advantage in several botanic gardens.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1095. <em>To plant and make Edgings.</em>&mdash;Edgings of daisies, thrift,
violets, gentianella, &amp;c., should be planted in February; but
those of box succeed better, if planted in April or August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1096. <em>To train Evergreen and other Hedges.</em>&mdash;Evergreen
hedges may be clipt about the beginning, but not later than
the middle of April, as by that time they will begin to grow&mdash;and
it is proper that this work should be previously performed.
Some content themselves with clipping but once a year, in
which case the end of July, or first of August, is a better time.</p>

<p>In trimming these, or indeed any hedge intended as a close
fence, they should be dressed up to a thin edge at top, as otherwise
they are apt to get full of gaps below; and the cause is
obvious, that the under part, in square or cut hedges, is too
much shaded by the upper part. Now, by sloping the sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
every part of the hedge is freely exposed to the air; nor is any
part over-dropped by another. A hedge, intended merely as
a fence, need seldom be more than five feet high, or at most
six. Screen hedges may be allowed to run to any height
thought necessary for the purpose; neither is it requisite to trim
them so often as fence-hedges; once a year, or in two years,
may be sufficient.</p>

<p>In the training of any hedge, it should not be topped or shortened,
till it has arrived at a full yard in height; but it may
then have a little taken off the points, in order to make it bush
the better, and shoot afterwards of a more regular height; the
sides, however, should be trimmed from the second or third
year of planting, that it may grow the more complete and close
below, for therein consists the excellence of any fence. It should
not in topping, at any time while in training, be much cut in,
as that would make it push the stronger to the top, to the detriment
of the sides. When fence-hedges outgrow their limits,
they must, of course, be cut either wholly or partly down; but
if they be tolerably well kept, it is seldom necessary to cut
them down more than half to the ground.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1097. <em>How to cut Box Edgings.</em>&mdash;Box edgings should be cut
about the beginning of April, or in the end of July. They
should, however, be cut once a year, and should be kept two
inches in breadth at bottom; being tapered up to a thin edge
at top; for nothing looks so ill as a large, bushy edging, especially
to a narrow walk. The use of edging is to separate the
earth from the gravel; and the larger they are allowed to grow,
the less effectual they become; getting the more open below,
as they advance in height. Such also harbor snails, and other
troublesome vermin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1098. <em>A sure method of curing Gravel-Walks.</em>&mdash;Three parts
pond-water to one of brine, from the salting-tub in a family,
poured with a watering-pot upon gravel-walks, will not only
kill the moss upon them, but drive away the worms which
make so many holes in them, and also prevent weeds springing
up. This a gentleman lately tried, who has several gravel-walks
in a grove near his house. Since he moistened his walks
with brine&mdash;which is now four years ago&mdash;they are incommoded
neither by moss, weeds, nor worms. Every autumn he causes
them to be well watered with the brine and pond-water, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
a whole week, to prevent moss; and a week in the spring, to
guard against weeds and worms; besides giving them a sprinkling
every now and then, in the summer-season, when they
seem to want it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1099. <em>Proper method of laying Carnations.</em>&mdash;In summer,
towards the latter-end of June, or any time in July or beginning
of August, when the shoots of the year are advanced to a
proper growth, being from four, five, or six, to seven or eight
inches long, which are to be laid as they grow on the plants,
and to remain affixed thereto till rooted on the ground.</p>

<p>Thus far observed, begin the work by first clearing away all
weeds about the plants, and loosen the earth a little around
them, and if the surface is low, add some mould thereto sufficient
to raise it high enough to receive the layers easily; then
begin laying the shoots one by one; strip off the lower leaves
so as to have some inches of a clear shoot below; and trim the
top leaves shorter and even, and then slit or gash the shoot on
the under side; in doing which, fix on a joint about the middle
of the shoot underneath, and with your sharp knife cut half
through the joint, and slanting upwards; so as to slit the shoot
up the middle half an inch, or but little more; which done,
directly lay it, by bending it down to the earth with the gash
or slit part open, making an opening in the earth, and peg it
down with one or two of the small-hooked sticks, and earth
over the body of the layer an inch or two deep, still keeping
the slit open and the top raised gently upright, pressing the
earth moderately upon them; and in this manner proceed with
laying all the shoots on each plant; and when all are laid, give
a gentle watering to settle the earth close about the layers,
and repeat it frequently in dry weather.</p>

<p>They will soon emit roots at the gash or slit part, generally at
the bottom of the tongue, and in five or six weeks will often be
rooted fit for separating and planting off from the parent, so
that when they have been about five, six, or seven weeks laid,
you will examine the progress they have made in rooting, by
opening the earth gently about some of the layers; and as
soon as they appear to be tolerably rooted, let them be cut off
from the old plant with a sharp knife, in order to be timely
planted out in nursery beds, that they may root more abundantly,
and get due strength before winter; observing, in cutting
them off from the mother plant, to open the ground so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to take them up with all the roots they have made, and cut
them clean off beyond the gash; afterwards trim off any naked
woody part or bottom, but preserve all the roots, and trim the
long tops a little, then plant them in nursery rows, six inches
asunder, or you may prick some in small pots, one layer in
each, giving water directly at planting, and repeat it often in
dry weather till they take good root, and grow freely, keeping
them clean from weeds.</p>

<p>Those in the nursery beds will, by October, be good strong
plants. The choicest sorts may then be planted in pots, to
move under occasional shelter in time of severe frost, and for
which purpose, either use small pots (32) to contain them all
winter, or plant them in large pots (24 or 16) to remain to
flower, observing to take them up out of the nursery beds for
potting, &amp;c., with a garden trowel, each layer with a good ball
of earth about the roots; and having the pots ready, place a
shell over the holes at bottom, and put some good light rich
earth therein; plant one layer with its ball about the roots entire
in each pot, fill up with more earth, and give some water;
you may also at the same time plant some of the more ordinary
or common sorts into flower-borders or beds, to stand the
full weather all the year; but the choicer sorts in the pots may,
in November, be placed close together, either in a garden-frame,
to have occasional protection of the glasses, or mats, in
severe frost, and have the full air in all open weather and mild
days, or may be plunged in a raised bed of any dry compost,
raised some inches above the common level, and arched over
with hoop arches, in order to be protected with occasional covering
of garden mats when hard frosts prevail; but in either
method, be sure to expose them fully in all open weather, as
aforesaid.</p>

<p>In the spring, such as have remained all winter in small pots
should, in February or early in March, be turned out with the
ball of earth about the root, and planted into larger pots, to
remain for flowering, giving proper waterings; and those which
were potted at once into larger pots in autumn should now have
the earth stirred at top, taking out some, and fill up with fresh
good earth, and give a little water.</p>

<p>The layers planted in the common borders of the pleasure
and flower garden require no other care than keeping them
clean from weeds, and tying up the flower stalks to sticks when
they are advanced long enough to require support.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1100. <em>To remove Herbs and Flowers in the Summer.</em>&mdash;If you
have occasion to transplant in the summer season, let it be in
the evening after the heat is past; plant and water the same
immediately, and there will be no danger from the heat next
day; but be careful, in digging up the earth, you do not break
any of the young shoots, as the sap will exude out of the same
to the great danger of the plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1101. <em>New Method of raising Cucumbers.</em>&mdash;From the best
seed that can be got of the common prickly cucumber, raise
plants on a moderate hot-bed, not hurrying them too much in
their growth. In May, when the danger of the frost is nearly
over, familiarize the plants, by degrees, to the air, and towards
the latter end of the month plant them in the open ground
against a south wall. Take care not to give them too much
water, as that will injure the fruit. When they have run up
about five feet, they will send forth blossoms, and the fruit will
begin to show itself soon after. The flesh of cucumbers raised
in this manner will be thicker and firmer, and the flavor vastly
more delicious, than those raised from the same seed, but
planted in the ordinary way, and the runners suffered to trail
on the ground. Though a south wall in most gardens, is too
much appropriated to other things, to give room for cucumbers
in general, yet in every garden a few plants may be so trained
by way of rarity, and to save seed, which is found to be greatly
improved by this method, so as to produce much better
cucumbers in the common way of raising them. One or two
plants, so raised, will supply a sufficient quantity of seed for a
large garden.</p>

<p>Laying a cucumber or melon-bed with tiles, is also of particular
service in improving the fruit, and giving it a proper
flavor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1102. <em>To prevent the irregular Growth of Melons.</em>&mdash;It is well
known that melons frequently, in certain situations, lose their
circular form, and grow larger on one side than the other, and
that those misshapen fruits are always bad. To remedy this,
take a small forked stick, in proportion to the size of the melon,
and thrust it in the ground as nearly as possible to the tail of
the fruit, taking the precaution to lay a little moss between the
two prongs, and suspend the melon to this fork. In a few days
the melon will resume its form, when the fork may be removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and the operation is finished. The quality of the fruit remains
unchanged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1103. <em>Easy Method of producing Mushrooms.</em>&mdash;If the water
wherein mushrooms have been steeped or washed be poured
upon an old bed, or if the broken parts of mushrooms be
strewed thereon, there will speedily arise great numbers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1104. <em>To obtain a good Crop of Onions.</em>&mdash;In order to obtain
a good crop of onions, it is proper to sow at different seasons,
viz., in light soils, in August, January, or early in February;
and in heavy wet soils, in March, or early in April. Onions,
however, should not be sown in January, unless the ground be
in a dry state, which is not often the case at so early a period
of the season; but if so, advantage should be taken of it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1105. <em>The Advantage of sowing Peas in Circles instead of
straight Rows.</em>&mdash;It is a great error in those persons who sow
the rows of tall-growing peas close together. It is much better
in all those sorts, which grow six or eight feet high, to have
only one row, and then to leave a bed ten or twelve feet wide
for onions, carrots, or any crops which do not grow tall.</p>

<p>The advantages which will be derived are, that the peas will
not be drawn up so much, be stronger, will flower much nearer
to the ground, and in wet weather can be more easily gathered
without wetting you.</p>

<p>But instead of sowing peas in straight rows, if you will form
the ground into circles of three feet diameter, with a space of
two feet between each circle, in a row thirty feet long, you will
have six circles of peas, each nine feet, in all fifty-four feet of
peas, instead of thirty, on the same extent of ground.</p>

<p>If you want more than one row of circles, leave a bed of ten
or twelve feet before you begin another.</p>

<p>For the very tall sorts, four feet circles will afford more
room for the roots to grow in, and care must be taken, by applying
some tender twigs, or strings, to prevent the circles from
joining each other.</p>

<p>This method is equally applicable for scarlet-beans.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1106. <em>To raise Peas in Autumn, and to prevent Mice from
eating them when sown.</em>&mdash;The purple-flowered peas are found to
answer best for a late crop in autumn, as they are not so liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to be mildewed as many of the other sorts, and will continue
flowering till the frost stops them.</p>

<p>Those peas may be sown in July, August, or so late as the
first week in September, if sown in a warm, sheltered situation,
and in a soil inclining to sand.</p>

<p>Soak the peas in warm milk, and after you have drawn the
drills, water them before you sow the peas; it is best to sow
them towards the evening. If the autumn should prove very
dry, they will require frequent watering.</p>

<p>When peas are sown before winter, or early in spring, they
are very apt to be eaten by mice.</p>

<p>To prevent this, soak the peas for a day or two in train oil
before you sow them, which will encourage their vegetation,
and render them so obnoxious to the mice, that they will not
eat them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1107. <em>Method of cultivating Radishes for Salad, so as to have
them ready at all seasons of the year.</em>&mdash;Take seeds of the common
radish, and lay them in rain-water to steep for twenty-four hours;
then put them quite wet into a small linen bag, well tied at the
mouth with packthread. If you have steeped a large quantity
of seeds, you may divide them into several bags. Then expose
the bags in a place where they will receive the greatest heat of
the sun, for about twenty-four hours, at the end of which time
the seed will begin to grow, and you may then sow it in the
usual manner, in earth well exposed to the heat of the sun.
Prepare two small tubs to cover each other exactly. These
may be easily provided, by sawing a small cask through the
middle, and they will serve in winter; in summer one will be
sufficient for each kind of earth that has been sown. As soon
as you have sown your seeds you must cover them with your
tub, and at the end of three days you will find radishes of the
size and thickness of young lettuces, having at their extremities
two small round leaves, rising from the earth, of a reddish
color. These radishes, cut or pulled up, will be excellent, if
mixed with salad, and they have a much more delicate taste
than the common radishes which are eaten with salt.</p>

<p>By taking the following precautions, you may have them in
the winter, and even during the hardest frosts: After having
steeped the seeds in warm water, and exposed them to the sun,
as already directed, or in a place sufficiently hot to make them
shoot forth, warm the two tubs; fill one of them with earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
well dunged; sow your seeds, thus prepared, in one of them,
and cover it with the other tub; you must then be careful to
sprinkle it with warm water as often as may be necessary.
Then carry the two tubs closely joined, taking care they cover
each other, into a warm vault, or cellar, and at the end of fifteen
days you may gather a fine salad.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1108. <em>To preserve Strawberry Plants from the Heat of the
Sun, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Sir Joseph Banks, from a variety of experiments,
and the experience of many years, recommends a general revival
of the now almost obsolete practice of laying straw under
strawberry-plants, when the fruit begins to swell; by which
means the roots are shaded from the sun, the waste of moisture
by evaporation prevented, the leaning fruit kept from damage
by resting on the ground, particularly in wet weather, and
much labor in watering saved. Twenty trusses of long straw
are sufficient for 1800 feet of plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1109. <em>Directions for managing Strawberries in Summer.</em>&mdash;On
the management of strawberries in June and July, the future
prosperity of them greatly depends; and if each plant has not
been kept separate, by cutting off the runners, they will be in
a state of confusion, and you will find three different sorts of
plants.</p>

<p>1. Old plants, whose roots are turned black, hard, and
woody.</p>

<p>2. Young plants, not strong enough to flower.</p>

<p>3. Flowering plants, which ought only to be there, and perhaps
not many of them.</p>

<p>Before the time of flowering is quite over, examine them,
and pull up every old plant which has not flowered; for, if
once they have omitted to flower, you may depend upon it
they never will produce any after, being too old, and past bearing;
but to be fully convinced, leave two or three, set a stick
to them, and observe them the next year.</p>

<p>If the young plants, runners of last year, be too thick, take
some of them away, and do not leave them nearer than a foot
of the scarlet, alpines, and wood, and fifteen or sixteen inches
of all the larger sorts; and in the first rainy weather in July or
August, take them all up, and make a fresh plantation with
them, and they will be very strong plants for flowering next
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Old beds, even if the plants be kept single at their proper
distance, examine, and pull all the old plants which have not
flowered.</p>

<p>When the fruit is nearly all gathered, examine them again,
and cut off the runners; but if you want to make a fresh plantation,
leave some of the two first, and cut off all the rest. Then
stir up the ground with a trowel, or three-pronged fork, and in
August they will be fit to transplant.</p>

<p>If you have omitted in July, do not fail in August, that the
runners may make good roots, to be transplanted in September;
for, if later, the worms will draw them out of the ground,
and the frost afterwards will prevent them from striking root;
the consequence of which is, their not flowering the next spring;
and you will lose a year.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1110. <em>To cultivate the common Garden Rhubarb.</em>&mdash;It is not
enough to give it depth of good soil, but it must be watered in
drought; and in winter must be well covered with straw or
dung. If this is attended to, your rhubarb will be solid when
taken out of the ground; and your kitchen, if a warm one,
will soon fit it for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1111. <em>Method of cultivating and curing Turkey Rhubarb from
Seed.</em>&mdash;The seed should be sown about the beginning of February,
on a bed of good soil, (if rather sandy, the better) exposed
to an east or west aspect in preference to the south; a full sun
being prejudicial to the vegetation of the seeds, and to the
plants whilst young.</p>

<p>The seeds are best sown moderately thick, (broad cast) treading
them regularly in, as is usual with parsnips and other light
seeds, and then raking the ground smooth. When the season
is wet, make a bed for sowing the rhubarb seeds upon, about
two feet thick, with new dung from the stable, covering it near
one foot thick with good soil. The intent of this bed is not for
the sake of warmth, but solely to prevent the rising of earth-worms,
which in a moist season will frequently destroy the
young crop.</p>

<p>If the seed is good, the plants often rise too thick; if so,
when they have attained six leaves, they should be taken up
carefully, (where too close), leaving the standing crop eight or
ten inches apart: those taken up may be planted at the same
distance in a fresh spot of ground, in order to furnish other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
plantations. When the plants in general are grown to the size
that cabbage-plants are usually set out for a standing crop, they
are best planted where they are to remain, in beds four feet
wide, one row along the middle of the bed, leaving two yards'
distance between the plants, allowing an alley between the beds
about a foot wide, for conveniency of weeding the plants.</p>

<p>In the autumn, when the decayed leaves are removed, if the
shoveling of the alleys is thrown over the crowns of the plants,
it will be found of service.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1112. <em>Cultivation of Turkey Rhubarb, by offsets.</em>&mdash;Slip off
several offsets from the heads of large plants; set them with
a dibble about a foot apart, in order to remove them into other
beds; and, in the autumn, they will be in a thriving state.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1113. <em>Method of curing Rhubarb.</em>&mdash;The plants may be taken
up, either early in the spring or in autumn, when the leaves
are decayed, in dry weather, if possible: when the roots are to
be cleared from dirt, (without washing,) let them be cut into
pieces, and, with a sharp knife, freed from the outer coat, and
exposed to the sun and air for a few days, to render the outside
a little dry.</p>

<p>In order to accelerate the curing of the largest pieces, a hole
may be scooped out with a pen-knife; these and the smaller
parts are then to be strung on packthread, and hung up in a
warm room, where it is to remain till perfectly dry. Each
piece may be rendered more sightly by a common file, fixing it
in a small vice during that operation; afterwards rub over it
a very fine powder, which the small roots furnish in beautiful
perfection, for this and every other purpose where rhubarb is
required.</p>

<p>An easier and simpler method of drying rhubarb is, after
cutting the root into handsome pieces, to wrap up each separately,
in one or more pieces of whitish-brown paper, and then
to place them on the hob of a common Bath stove. Lemon
and orange-peel dry beautifully in this way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1114. <em>Proper Soil for the culture of Turnips.</em>&mdash;Sandy loams,
in good heart, are most favorable to their growth, though they
will thrive well on strong loams, if they are not wet; but on
clayey, thin, or wet soils, they are not worth cultivating; for
though a good crop may be raised on such ground, when well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
prepared and dunged, more damage is done by taking off the
turnips in winter, in poaching the soil, than the value of the
crop will repay.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1115. <em>Preservation of Succulent Plants.</em>&mdash;Green succulent
plants are better preserved after a momentary immersion in
boiling water, than otherwise. This practice has been successfully
used in the preservation of cabbage and other plants, dried
for keeping; it destroys the vegetable life at once, and, in a
great degree, prevents that decay which otherwise attends them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1116. <em>Various useful properties of Tobacco to Gardeners.</em>&mdash;Tobacco
is employed for so many different uses, that there is
no person possessed of a garden but will find both pleasure
and profit in the cultivation of it, especially as it is now at
such a high price. The seed is very cheap, and may be procured
of most nurserymen, and will answer the same end as
the foreign for most purposes, and considerably cheaper.</p>

<p><em>Uses to which it may be applied.</em>&mdash;1. To florists, for two elegant
annual plants to decorate the borders of the flower-garden;
or, on account of their height, to fill up vacant places in the
shrubberies; or, when put into pots, they will be very ornamental
in the green-house during the winter.</p>

<p>2. Kitchen-gardeners would in a few days lose their crops
of melons, if not immediately fumigated with tobacco-smoke,
when attacked by the red spider; and it is useful to destroy
the black flies on cucumbers in frames.</p>

<p>3. Fruit-gardeners. When peach and nectarine-trees have
their leaves curled up, and the shoots covered with smother-flies;
or, the cherry-trees have the ends of the shoots infested
with the black dolphin-fly; canvas, pack-sheets, or doubled
mats, nailed before them, and frequently fumigated under them,
will destroy those insects.</p>

<p>4. Forcing-gardeners, who raise roses and kidney-beans in
stoves, can soon destroy the green flies which cover the stalks
and buds of roses, and the insects which appear like a mildew
on kidney-beans, by the assistance of the fumigating bellows.</p>

<p>5. Nurserymen. When the young shoots of standard cherry-trees,
or any other trees, are covered with the black dolphin-flies,
an infusion is made with the leaves and stalks of tobacco;
a quantity is put into an earthen pan, or small, oblong wooden
trough; one person holds this up, whilst another gently bends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the top of each tree, and lets the branches remain about a minute
in the liquor, which destroys them.</p>

<p>6. Graziers, when their sheep are infected with the scab, find
relief from making a sheep-water with an infusion of the leaves
and stalks. Moles, when only a few hills are at first observed,
may probably be soon driven out of the ground, by fumigating
their holes.</p>

<p>7. Herb tobacco is also greatly improved by having some of
the leaves, when dried, cut with a pair of scissors, and mixed
with the herbs in any quantity you may think proper, according
to the strength you require, and save you the expense of buying
tobacco.</p>

<p>The herbs generally used for this purpose are colt's-foot and
wood betony-leaves; the leaves and flowers of lavender, rosemary,
thyme, and some others of the like nature.</p>

<h4>THE ORCHARD.</h4>

<p>1117. <em>To prevent Blossom and Fruit-trees from being damaged
by early Spring Frost.</em>&mdash;If a rope (a hempen one, it is presumed)
be introduced among the branches of a fruit-tree in blossom,
and the end of it brought down, so as to terminate in a bucket
of water; and, should a slight frost take place in the night-time,
in that case the tree will not be affected by the frost;
but a film of ice, of considerable thickness, will be formed on
the surface of the bucket in which the rope's-end is immersed,
although it has often happened that another bucket of water,
placed beside it for the sake of experiment, has had no ice at all
upon it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1118. <em>Chinese mode of propagating Fruit-trees.</em>&mdash;The ingenious
people of China have a common method of propagating several
kinds of fruit-trees, which of late years has been practised with
success in Bengal. The method is simply this:&mdash;They strip
a ring of bark, about an inch in width, from a bearing branch,
surround the place with a ball of fat earth, or loam, bound fast
to the branch with a piece of matting: over this they suspend
a pot or horn, with water, having a small hole in the bottom
just sufficient to let the water drop, in order to keep the earth
constantly moist. The branch throws new roots into the earth
just above the place where the ring of bark was stripped off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
The operation is performed in the spring, and the branch is
sawed off and put into the ground at the fall of the leaf. The
following year it will bear fruit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1119. <em>To improve Fruit-trees by attention to the Color of the
Soil.</em>&mdash;The color and also the quality of soils have an effect
on the color and flavor of fruits&mdash;even on the color of many
flowers. The effects of the color of soils on that of fruits, are
most perceptible on the delicate kinds, such as grapes, peaches,
&amp;c.; but to a nice observer, it extends in a greater or less degree
to all fruits. For instance, if two black Hamburgh grapes,
made from the cuttings of the same plant, shall be planted, the
one in a dry, hazelly loam, and the other in a moist, black earth,
the fruit of the one will be brown, or of a grizzly color, and the
other very dark red or black; and the grape will be more juicy,
though better in flavor, than the other grown in a dryer soil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1120. <em>To increase the Growth in Trees.</em>&mdash;It may be depended
upon as a fact, that by occasionally washing the stems of trees,
their growth will be greatly increased; for several recent experiments
have proved, that all the ingredients of vegetation united,
which are received from the roots, stem, branches, and leaves
of a mossy and dirty tree, do not produce half the increase
either in wood or fruit, that another gains whose stem is clean.
It is clearly obvious, that proper nourishment cannot be received
from rain, for the dirty stem will retain the moisture
longer than when clean; and the moss and dirt will absorb the
finest parts of the dew, and likewise act as a screen, by depriving
the tree of that share of sun and air which it requires.</p>

<p>A common scrubbing-brush and clean water is all that is necessary,
only care must be observed not to injure the bark.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1121. <em>To prevent Hares and Rabbits from Barking young
Plantations.</em>&mdash;Hares, rabbits, and rats, have a natural antipathy
to tar; but tar, though fluid, contracts, when exposed to the
sun and air for a time, a great dryness and a very binding
quality; and if applied to trees in its natural state, will occasion
them to be bark-bound. To remove this difficulty, tar is of so
strong a savor, that a small quantity mixed with other things,
in their nature open and loose, will give the whole mixture such
a degree of its own taste and smell, as will prevent hares, &amp;c.,
touching what it is applied to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Take any quantity of tar, and six or seven times as much
grease, stirring and mixing them well together; with this composition
brush the stems of young trees, as high as hares, &amp;c.,
can reach; and it will effectually prevent their being barked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1122. <em>Bad effects of Iron Nails, &amp;c., on Fruit-trees, or mischievous
effects of Iron Nails, in conjunction with Branches of
Fruit-trees.</em>&mdash;It often happens that some of the limbs of fruit-trees,
trained against a wall, are blighted and die, while others
remain in a healthy and flourishing state. This has been
hitherto erroneously attributed to the effects of lightning; but,
from closer observation, and from several experiments, it has
been found to arise from the corroding effects of the rust of the
nails and cramps with which trees in this situation are fastened.
To avoid this inconvenience, therefore, it requires only to be
careful in preventing the iron from coming in contact with the
bark of the trees.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1123. <em>To destroy Moss on Trees.</em>&mdash;Remove it with a hard
scrubbing-brush, in February and March, and wash the trees
with cow-dung, urine, and soap-suds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1124. <em>Necessity of taking off superfluous Suckers from Shrubs.</em>&mdash;Many
flowering shrubs put out strong suckers from the root,
such as lilacs, syringa, and some of the kinds of roses, which
take greatly from the strength of the mother-plant; and which,
if not wanted for the purpose of planting next season, should
be twisted off, or otherwise destroyed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1125. <em>To cure the Disease in Apple-trees.</em>&mdash;Brush off the
white down, clear off the red stain underneath it, and anoint
the places infected with a liquid mixture of train-oil and Scotch-snuff.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1126. <em>To cure the Canker in Trees.</em>&mdash;Cut them off to the
quick, and apply a piece of sound bark from any other tree,
and bind it on with a flannel roller. Cut off the canker, and
a new shoot will grow strong, but in a year or two you will
find it cankered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1127. <em>A method of curing Fruit-trees infected with an Easterly
Blight.</em>&mdash;Where valuable fruit-trees are infected with this blight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
they may, with little trouble and expense be in a short time
cured, by fumigating them with brimstone strewed on lighted
charcoal; this effectually kills it; but the workman must observe
to get to windward of the trees, as the fumes, both of
brimstone and charcoal, are very offensive and pernicious.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller recommends washing and sprinkling the blighted
trees from time to time, with common water, (that is, such as
hath not had anything steeped in it,) and the sooner that is
performed, (whenever we apprehend danger,) the better; and
if the young and tender shoots seem to be much infected, wash
them with a woollen cloth, so as to clear them, if possible,
from all glutinous matter, that their respiration and perspiration
may not be obstructed; and if some broad, flat pans, or tubs,
are placed near the trees, it will keep their tender parts in a
ductile state, and greatly help them; but whenever this operation
of washing the trees is performed, it should be early in
the day, that the moisture may be exhaled before the cold
of the night comes on, especially if the nights are frosty; nor
should it be done when the sun shines very hot upon the wall,
which would be subject to scorch up the tender blossom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1128. <em>Experienced method of healing Wounds in Trees.</em>&mdash;This
method consists in making a varnish of common linseed oil,
rendered very drying, by boiling it, for the space of an hour,
with an ounce of litharge to each pound of oil, mixed with
calcined bones, pulverized and sifted, to the consistence of an
almost liquid paste. With this paste the wounds of trees are
to be covered, by means of a brush, after the bark and other
substance have been pared, so as to render the whole as smooth
and even as possible. The varnish must be applied in dry
weather, in order that it may attach itself properly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1129. <em>Composition for healing Wounds in Trees.</em>&mdash;Take of
dry, pounded chalk, <em>three</em> measures; add of common vegetable
tar, <em>one</em> measure; mix them thoroughly, and boil them, with
a low heat, till the composition becomes of the consistency of
bees'-wax: it may be preserved for use, in this state, for any
length of time. If chalk cannot conveniently be got, dry brick-dust
may be substituted.</p>

<p><em>Application.</em>&mdash;After the broken or decayed limb has been
sawed off, the whole of the <em>saw-cut</em> must be very carefully pared
away, and the rough edges of the bark, in particular must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
made quite smooth; the doing of this properly is of great consequence;
then lay on the above composition, hot, about the
thickness of half-a-dollar, over the wounded place, and over the
edges of the surrounding bark; it should be spread with a hot
trowel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1130. <em>To prune Wall Fruit.</em>&mdash;Cut off all fresh shoots, however
fair they may appear to the eye, that will not, without
much bending, be well placed to the wall; for if any branch
happen to be twisted or bruised in the bending or turning
(which you may not easily perceive), although it may grow
and prosper for the present, yet it will decay in time, and the
sap or gum will issue from that place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1131. <em>To prune Vines to Advantage.</em>&mdash;In pruning vines, leave
some new branches every year, and take away (if too many)
some of the old, which will be of great advantage to the tree,
and much increase the quantity of fruit.</p>

<p>When you trim your vine, leave two knots, and cut them
off the next time; for, usually, the two buds yield a bunch of
grapes. Vines, thus pruned, have been known to bear abundantly,
whereas others that have been cut close to please the
eye, have been almost barren of fruit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1132. <em>The most proper Times when Leaves of Trees ought to
be collected for pharmaceutical and economical Purposes.</em>&mdash;It is at
that period when the plant is in full flower, that the leaves possess
their full virtue. They drop off when their particular life
has terminated.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>TIMBER.</h4>

<p>1133. <em>To promote the Growth of Forest-trees.</em>&mdash;It is highly to
be censured, the neglect of permitting ivy-twines, which grow
to forest-trees, to remain attached to them. Their roots entering
into the bark, rob the trees of much of their nourishment;
they in a manner strangle their supporters, by impeding the
circulation of their juices, and in time destroy the trees. They
should be torn up by the roots, for, if any part of them adhere
to the tree, they will spread, as they obtain nourishment by their
adhering roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1134. <em>White-washing the Trunks of Trees, recommended.</em>&mdash;Being
one day upon a visit (observes Mr. Northmore, who
recommends this experiment) at my friend's near Yarmouth,
in the Isle of Wight, I remarked that several of the trunks of
trees in his orchard had been covered with whitewash; upon
inquiring the reason, he replied, that he had done it with a view
to keep off the hares, and other animals, and that it was
attended not only with that good effect, but several others, for
it made the rind smooth and compact, by closing up the cracks;
it entirely destroyed the moss; and as the rains washed off the
lime, it manured the roots. These several advantages, derived
from so simple a practice, deserve to be more generally known.
The white-wash is made in the usual manner with lime, and
may be applied twice, or oftener, if necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1135. <em>To cure Wounds in Trees.</em>&mdash;Wounds in trees are best
cured by covering them with a coat of common lead paint without
turpentine (for turpentine is poison to vegetation) in the
sun, on a fine dry day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1136. <em>Trees for Shade, Nursery Trees, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Forest Trees
selected for shade should be of kinds not liable to be attacked
by worms and insects. The rock or sugar maple is always remarkably
free from worms, and it makes the most dense and
beautiful shade of all our deciduous trees. This is becoming a
very popular tree, and we hope to see it extensively propagated.
There is no more risk in transplanting this than the
elm, and the limbs are not liable to be broken by the winds
and snow.</p>

<p>We believe it is generally admitted that transplanted trees
succeed best when their early growth has been in soil similar
to that for which they are destined to be placed permanently.
If raised in such a soil, and transplanted to that which is thin
and poor, they seem to receive a shock from which with difficulty
they recover. As a gentleman once remarked, it is like
feeding a calf with all the milk he will take till he is six
months old, and then suddenly turning him off to live on a short
pasture.</p>

<p>Large trees may be as successfully planted as small ones.
The mode and result of an experiment made by Messrs. Pomeroy
and Dutton, of Utica, are thus given: Those gentlemen
transplanted trees, comprising maples, elm, beech, &amp;c., some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
thirty feet in height, which were transplanted without being
shorn of any of their branches. The process of removal was as
follows:&mdash;In the fall, before the frost, a trench was dug around
the trees selected, from ten to fifteen feet in diameter, and the
roots severed. In the winter when the ground had become
solid from freezing, the trees were pulled out by the aid of
oxen and levers, with the mass of earth firmly attached to the
roots. They were then transported erect on a strong sled, built
for the purpose, and set out.</p>

<p>These trees grew in open land, a mile and a half from the
city. They put on their foliage last spring, as if wholly unconscious
that they were not still in their native soil, and the enterprising
gentlemen who undertook this unusual course, are
rewarded with shade trees which by the old practice it would
have required twenty years to produce.</p>

<p>Summer pruning is sometimes necessary in order to give form
and proper direction to nursery trees, and standard trees may
need thinning, in order to expose the fruit to light and air; but
in pruning trees thoroughly, particularly if large limbs are to
be cut off, it is best to defer the business till the last of July,
August, or the former part of September.</p>

<p>Late in summer and early in autumn, the bark does not peel
as it does early in the summer, when it often starts from the
tree which is injured by going into trees and stepping on limbs
with hard shoes. The sap will ooze out of some trees early in
summer, which not only injures them generally, but it often
causes the wounded part to decay.</p>

<p>But in late pruning, the wood, when the branch is cut off, becomes
sound and well seasoned; and though it may not heal
over so readily as when cut early in summer or spring, it remains
in a healthy state.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1137. <em>To preserve Wood in Damp Situations.</em>&mdash;Two coats of
the following preparation are to be applied, after which the
wood is subject to no deterioration whatever from humidity.
Twelve pounds of resin are to be beaten in a mortar, to which
three pounds of sulphur and twelve pints of whale oil are to be
added. This mixture is to be melted over the fire, and stirred
during the operation. Ochre, reduced to an impalpable powder,
by triturating it with oil, may then be combined in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
proportion necessary to give either a lighter or a darker color
to the material. The first coat should be put on lightly, having
been previously heated; the second may be applied in two
or three days, and a third after an equal interval, if from the
peculiar dampness of the situation it should be judged expedient.</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em>&mdash;It is highly probable (though the experiment has
not been tried) that this composition would be improved by
adding a small portion of the liquid leather, which is now commonly
sold in London, being the refuse of the purification of
fish oil by tar.</p>

<p>Where the work will bear the expense, and is not exposed to
a heat of more than 130 degrees of Fahrenheit, the best composition
is the following: Equal parts of turpentine (the fluid
resin, not the essential oil), bees'-wax, black resin and maltha,
or coal tar, boiled together till they cease to rise&mdash;that is, till
the white cream or scum proceeding from the separation of the
essential oil disappears. Apply it warm with a turpentine
brush&mdash;two or three coats, to cover the cracks or pores left by
the brush. This lute was first proposed by Chaptal, without
the addition of the coal tar, which is a great improvement. A
piece of wood covered with three coats of it, and immersed for
two years in water, was found to be quite dry on cutting off the
lute.</p>

<p>Take care not to allow water to fall into the pan, as it would
make the hot materials explode. If the composition catch fire,
put on the cover directly, and remove the pan for an instant
from the fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1138. <em>Cause and Prevention of the Dry Rot.</em>&mdash;The cause of
the dry rot in wood is moisture; and to prevent well-dried
timber from decaying above or under ground, is done by charring
it well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1139. <em>Cure for the Dry Rot in Timber, so as to make it indestructible
by Water.</em>&mdash;Melt twelve ounces of resin in an iron
pot; add three gallons of train oil, and three or four rolls of
brimstone; and when the brimstone and resin are melted and
become thin, add as much Spanish brown, or red and yellow
ochre, or any other color required, first ground fine with the
same oil, as will give the whole a shade of the depth preferred;
then lay it on with a brush as hot and thin as possible; some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
time after the first coat is dried, give it a second. This preparation
will preserve planks for ages, and keep the weather from
driving through brick work.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1140. <em>Method of trying the Goodness of Timber for Ship-building,
used in the Arsenal at Vienna.</em>&mdash;One person applies
his ear to the centre of one end of the trunk, while another,
with a key, hits the other end with a gentle stroke. If the
tree be sound and good, the stroke will be distinctly heard at
the other end, though the tree should be a hundred feet or
more in length.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1141. <em>To season and render Green Timber immediately fit
for use.</em>&mdash;After the timber has been cut down from the stock,
take off, immediately, both the outer bark and also the inner
rind, clean to the wood; cut it up to the different purposes for
which it may be wanted, whether scantlings for roofings, joists,
planks, deals, or the like. After preparing them for their
proper use, steep them in lime-water a few days, or pay them
over with a little of the lime, along with the water. The hotter
it is used after the lime is slaked, so much the better. Lime-water
is made by slaking the lime-shells in water. This will
answer equally well for round trees. The author of this method
says, he has been, for a great number of years past, used to
take down and repair both ancient and modern buildings, in
which a good deal of Scots fir had been used, but he never
found one inch either rotten or worm-eaten, where it was in the
least connected with lime, and kept dry; on the contrary, he
found it more hard and firm than when first used.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>BUILDING.</h4>

<p>1142. <em>Artificial Stone Floors and Coverings for Houses, as
made in some parts of Russia.</em>&mdash;The floors and coverings of
houses, in some parts of South Russia, are made in the following
manner:&mdash;For a floor, let the ground be made even, and
some stones of any shape be put on, and, with a heavy wooden
rammer, force or beat the stones into the ground, continuing
to beat the floor till it become quite even, and incapable of
receiving any farther impression. Then run lime, immediately
after it has been slaked, through a fine sieve, as expeditiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
as possible, because exposure to the air weakens the lime. Mix
two parts of coarse sand, or washed gravel, (for there must be
no earth in it,) with one part of lime-powder, and wet them
with bullocks' blood; so little moist, however, as merely to
prevent the lime from blowing away in powder; in short, the
less moist, the better. Spread it on the floor, and, without a
moment's loss of time, let several men be ready, with large
beetles, to beat the mixture, which will become more and more
moist by the excessive beating requisite. Then put on it some
of the dry sand and lime, mixed, and beat it till like a stone.
If required to be very fine, take for the next layer finely-sifted
lime, with about a tenth part of rye-flour, and a little ox-blood;
beat it till it becomes a very stiff mortar, and then smooth it
with a trowel. The next day, again smooth it with a trowel;
and so continue to do, daily, till it be entirely dry. When
it is quite dry and hard, rub it over with fresh ox-blood, taking
off all which it will not imbibe. No wet will penetrate this
composition, which, however, after some time, is often painted
with oil-colors. The whole floor appears as a single stone, and
nothing will affect it. The drier it is used, the better, provided
that, with much beating, it becomes like a very stiff mortar,
and evidently forms a compact body. On flat tops of houses,
the beetle, or rammers' ends, must be smaller, to prevent the
rebounding of the boards and timber, which would crack the
cement; but, when the thickness of a foot is laid on, it will
beat more firmly. A thin coating of ox-blood, flour, and lime,
being beat in large, strong, wooden troughs, or mortar, till it
can be spread with a trowel, may be used without beating it
again on the floor or house-top; but it must be very stiff, and
used most expeditiously. Even frost will not affect it. With
this composition, artificial stone may be made, rammed very
hard into strong wooden frames of the required shape; particularly
to turn arches for buildings of rammed earth. It is well
known, that earth which is not too argillaceous, with only the
moisture it has when fresh dug, on being rammed between
frames of wood, till the rammer will no longer impress it,
makes <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'eternal'">external</span> walls; but a mass as hard as stone may be made
with a little lime added to sand, horse-dung, and ox-blood.
The more the lime is beaten, the moister it becomes; and it
must contain so much moisture as to become, by beating, a
solid mass, adhering in all its parts, and not remain crumbling,
that will properly set as mortar. If there be too little moisture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
at first, it will remain a powder; if there be too much, it will
become a soft mortar. Lime is of no use, mixed with clay or
vegetable earths; which, if well beaten, are stronger without it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1143. <em>To cure Damp Walls.</em>&mdash;Boil two quarts of tar, with
two ounces of kitchen-grease, for a quarter of an hour, in an
iron pot. Add some of this tar to a mixture of slaked lime
and powdered glass, which have passed through a flour-sieve,
and been completely dried over the fire in an iron pot, in the
proportion of two parts of lime and one of glass, till the mixture
becomes of the consistence of thin plaster. The cement
must be used immediately after being mixed, and therefore it
is proper not to mix more of it than will coat one square foot
of wall, since it quickly becomes too hard for use; and care
must be taken to prevent any moisture from mixing with the
cement. For a wall merely damp, a coating one-eighth of an
inch thick is sufficient; but if the wall is wet, there must be a
second coat. Plaster made of lime, hair, and plaster of Paris,
may afterwards be laid on as a cement. The cement above
described will unite the parts of Portland stone or marble, so
as to make them as durable as they were prior to the fracture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1144. <em>To increase the Durability of Tiles for covering Buildings.</em>&mdash;The
following composition has been found to be of
extraordinary durability, as a glazing or varnish for tiles. No
sort of weather, even for a considerable length of time, has had
any effect upon it. It prevents that absorption of water, by
which common tiles are rendered liable to crumble into dust,
hinders the shivering of tiles, and gives to red bricks a soft
lustre, by which their appearance is much improved.</p>

<p>Over a weak fire heat a bottle of linseed oil, with an ounce
of litharge, and a small portion of minium, till such time as a
feather, used in stirring it, shall be burnt to the degree of being
easily rubbed to powder between the fingers. Then take off
the varnish, let it cool, clarify it from any impurities which
may have fallen to the bottom, and heat it again. Having,
in the mean time, melted from three to four ounces of pitch,
mix this with the warm varnish. The specific gravity of the
pitch hinders it from mingling thoroughly with the varnish,
though it even remain so long upon the fire as to be evaporated
to considerable thickness. It is not till the varnish be
cooled, nearly to the consistency of common syrup, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
effect takes place in the requisite degree. If it be too thick,
let hot varnish be added, to bring it to the proper consistency;
if it be too thin, add melted pitch. Next, put in as much brick-dust
as the mixture can receive, without being made too thick
for convenient use. The finer the brick-dust, and the easier
it is to be moved with the point of a pencil, so much the fitter
will it be to fill up the chinks and unevenness of the bricks,
and, as it were, to incorporate itself with their substance. Prepare
the brick-dust in the following manner:&mdash;Take a certain
number of pieces of good brick, beat them into dust, and sift
the dust in a hair-sieve. Then, to improve its fineness, rub it
on a stone with water, dry it, and mix it with the varnish in
the necessary proportion. If the brick-dust be naturally of too
dark a color, a portion of some that is brighter may be added,
to make the color clear.</p>

<p>It is to be laid on the tiles in the same manner in which
oil-colors in general are put upon the substances on which they
are applied. The composition must be heated from time to
time, when it is to be used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1145. <em>Economical Method of employing Tiles for the Roofs
of Houses.</em>&mdash;A French architect (M. Castala) has invented a
new method of employing tiles for the roofs of houses, so as to
save one half of the quantity usually employed for that purpose.
The tiles are made of a square instead of an oblong
form; and the hook that fastens them is at one of the angles,
so that, when fastened to the laths, they hang down <em>diagonally</em>,
and every tile is covered one-fifth part on two sides by the superior
row.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1146. <em>To improve Chimney Fire-places, and increase the Heat,
by a proper attention to the Setting of Stoves, Grates, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;The
best materials for setting stoves or grates are fire-stone and
common bricks and mortar. Both materials are fortunately
very cheap. When bricks are used, they should be covered
with a thin coating of plaster, which, when it is dry, should be
white-washed. The fire-stone should likewise be white-washed
when that is used; and every part of the fire-place, which is not
exposed to being soiled and made black by the smoke, should
be kept as white and clear as possible. As <em>white</em> reflects more
heat, as well as more light, than any other color, it ought
always to be preferred for the inside of a chimney fire-place;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and <em>black</em>, which reflects neither light nor heat, should be more
avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1147. <em>To cure Smoky Chimneys.</em>&mdash;Put on the top of the
chimney a box, in each of whose sides is a door hanging on
hinges, and kept open by a thin iron rod running from one to
the other, and fastened by a ring in each end to a staple. When
there is no wind, these doors are at rest, and each forms an
angle of 45 degrees, which is decreased on the windward side
in proportion to the force of the wind, and increased in the
same ratio on the leeward side. If the wind be very strong,
the door opposed to the wind becomes close, while the opposite
one is opened as wide as it can be. If the wind strikes the
corner of the box, it shuts two doors and opens their opposites.
This scheme has been tried with success in a chimney which
always filled the room with smoke, but which, since adopted,
has never smoked the room at all. The expense is trifling, and
the apparatus simple.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1148. <em>A Preparation to preserve Wood from catching Fire,
and to preserve it from Decay.</em>&mdash;A member of the Royal Academy
at Stockholm says, in the memoirs of that academy,
"Having been within these few years to visit the alum mines
of Loswers, in the province of Calmar, I took notice of some
attempts made to burn the old staves of tubs and pails that
had been used for the alum works. For this purpose they were
thrown into the furnace, but those pieces of wood which had
been penetrated by the alum did not burn, though they remained
for a long time in the fire, where they only became red;
however, at last they were consumed by the intenseness of the
heat, but they emitted no flame."</p>

<p>He concludes, from this experiment, that wood, or timber,
for the purpose of building, may be secured against the action
of fire, by letting it remain for some time in water, wherein
vitriol, alum, or any other salt has been dissolved, which contains
no inflammable parts.</p>

<p>To this experiment it may be added, that wood, which has
been impregnated with water, wherein vitriol has been dissolved,
is very fit for resisting putrefaction, especially if afterwards
it is brushed over with tar, or some kind of paint; in
order to this, the wood must be rubbed with very warm vitriol
water, and afterwards left to dry, before it is painted or tarred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Wood prepared in this manner will for a long time resist the
injuries of the air, and be preserved in cellars and other low
moist places. It is to be observed, that if a solution of vitriol
is poured on such parts of timber where a sort of champignons
are formed by moisture, and rubbed off, none will ever
grow there again.</p>

<p>By boiling, for some hours, the spokes of wheels in vitriol
water, they are not subject to rottenness in the parts where
they enter the stocks. After boiling them in this manner, they
are dried as perfectly as possible, and then, in the accustomed
way, painted with oil color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1149. <em>Cheap and excellent Composition for preserving Weather
Boarding, Paling, and all other Works liable to be injured by the
Weather.</em>&mdash;Well burnt lime will soon become slaked by exposure
in the open air, or even if confined in a situation not remarkably
dry, so as to crumble of itself into powder. This is
called air-slaked lime, in contradistinction to that which is slaked
in the usual way, by being mixed with water. For the purpose
of making the present composition to preserve all sorts of wood-work
exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather, take three
parts of this air-slaked lime, two of wood-ashes, and one of fine
sand; pass them through a fine sieve, and add as much linseed-oil
to the composition as will bring it to a proper consistence
for working with a painter's brush. As particular care must
be taken to mix it perfectly, it should be ground on a stone
slab with a proper muller, in the same manner as painters
grind their white-lead, &amp;c.; but where these conveniences are
not at hand, the ingredients may be mixed in a large pan, and
well beat up with a wooden spatula. Two coats of this composition
being necessary, the first may be rather thin; but the
second should be as thick as it can conveniently be worked.
This most excellent composition for preserving wood, when exposed
to the injuries of the weather, is highly preferable to the
customary method of laying on tar and ochre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1150. <em>To make durable Barn-floors.</em>&mdash;A durable barn-floor
may be made of well-burnt polished brick on edge, placed in
the herring-bone form, on a pavement of stone three inches and
a half in thickness; or oaken plank two inches and a half in
thickness; or even of well-tempered indurated loam, of a proper
substance, not less than eight inches, and laid upon dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
materials or bottom. Any of them will make a durable barn-floor,
provided it is kept free from wet, wagon-wheels, and
horses' feet. The best threshing-floor for small farms of 150
acres is made of sound plank. In large farms (say 300 acres
and upwards) the threshing machine should supersede the flail.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1151. <em>The Virtues of Poplar Wood for the Flooring of Granaries.</em>&mdash;The
Lombard poplar is recommended as a timber adapted
for flooring granaries, which is said to prevent the destruction
of corn by weevils and insects. Poplar wood will not easily
take fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1152. <em>Improved Ventilators for Rooms.</em>&mdash;Different methods
are adopted for ventilating, or changing the air of rooms.&mdash;Thus:</p>

<p>Mr. Tid admitted fresh air into a room by taking out the
middle upper sash pane of glass, and fixing in its place a frame
box, with a round hole in its middle, about six or seven inches
diameter, in which hole is fixed, behind each other, a set of
sails, of very thin, broad copper plates, which spread over and
cover the circular hole, so as to make the air, which enters the
room, and turning round these sails, to spread round in thin
sheets sideway, and so not to incommode persons by blowing
directly upon them, as it would do if it were not hindered by
the sails. This well-known contrivance has generally been employed
in public buildings, but is very disagreeable in good
rooms; instead, of it, therefore, the late Mr. Whitehurst substituted
another, which was, to open a small square or rectangular
hole, in the party wall of the room, in the upper part,
near the ceiling, at a corner or part distant from the fire; before
it he placed a thin piece of metal, or pasteboard, &amp;c.,
attached to the wall in its lower part, just before the hole, but
declining from it upwards, so as to give the air that enters by
the hole a direction upwards against the ceiling, along which it
sweeps, and disperses itself through the room, without blowing
in a current against any person. This method is very useful to
cure smoky chimneys, by thus admitting, conveniently, fresh
air. A picture, placed before the hole, prevents the sight of it
from disfiguring the room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1153. <em>Approved Method of removing Bees.</em>&mdash;Set the hive
where there is only a glimmering light; turn it up; the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
first makes her appearance; once in possession of her, you are
master of all the rest; put her into an empty hive, whither she
will be followed by the other bees.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1154. <em>Useful Method of preserving Bees.</em>&mdash;Instead of destroying
whole swarms in their hives, to get the honey when the
hives are full, they clear them out into a fresh hive, while they
take the combs out of the old one; and they prevent their perishing
in winter by putting a great quantity of honey into a
very wide earthen vessel, covering its surface with paper, exactly
fitted on, and pricked full of holes with a large pin; this being
pressed by the weight of the bees, keeps a fresh supply continually
arising. Their most fatal destruction by severe cold they
prevent, by taking as many large tubs as they have hives, and
knocking out the heads, they set the other end in the ground,
laying a bed of dry earth or chopped hay in it, of six inches
deep; over this they place the head knocked out, and then
make a small wooden trough for the passage of the bees; this
is transfixed through a hole cut through each side of the tub, at
such a height as to lay on the false bottom, on which is placed
the covered dish of honey for the food of the bees, leaving a
proper space over this, covered with strong matting; they then
fill up the tub with more dry earth, or chopped hay, heaping it
up in the form of a cone, to keep out the rain, and wreathing it
over with straw on account of the warmth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1155. <em>Sir Ashton Lever's method of preserving Birds, Beasts,
Fishes, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Beasts.</span> Large beasts should be carefully skinned,
with the horns, skull, jaws, tail, and feet, left entire; the skins
may then either be put into a vessel of spirit, or else rubbed
well in the inside with the mixture of salt, alum, and pepper,
hereafter mentioned, and hung to dry. Small beasts may be
put into a cask of rum, or any other spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birds.</span> Large birds may be treated as large beasts, but must
not be put in spirits. Small birds may be preserved in the following
manner:&mdash;Take out the entrails, open a passage to the
brain, which should be scooped out through the mouth; introduce
into the cavities of the skull, and the whole body, some
of the mixture of salt, alum, and pepper, putting some through
the gullet and whole length of the neck; then hang the bird in
a cool, airy place&mdash;first by the feet, that the body may be impregnated
by the salts, and afterwards by a thread through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
under mandible of the bill, till it appears to be sweet; then
hang it in the sun, or near a fire: after it is well dried, clean
out what remains loose of the mixture, and fill the cavity of
the body with wool, oakum, or any soft substance, and pack it
smooth in paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fishes, &amp;c.</span> Large fishes should be opened in the belly, the
entrails taken out, and the inside well rubbed with pepper,
and stuffed with oakum. Small fishes put in spirit, as well as
reptiles and insects, except butterflies and moths; and any insects
of fine colors, should be pinned down in a box prepared
for that purpose, with their wings expanded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1156. <em>Birds that have been Shot.</em>&mdash;When fresh-killed, observe
to put tow into the mouth, and upon any wound they may
have received, to prevent the feathers being soiled; and then
wrap it smooth, at full-length, in paper, and pack it close in a
box. If it be sent from a great distance, the entrails should be
extracted, and the cavity filled with tow dipped in rum or other
spirit. The following mixture is proper for the preservation
of animals:&mdash;One pound of salt, four ounces of alum, and two
ounces of pepper, powdered together.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1157. <em>To preserve Game in Hot Weather.</em>&mdash;Game or poultry
may be preserved for a long time, by tying a string tight round
the neck, so as to exclude the air, and by putting a piece of
charcoal into the vent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1158. <em>Russian method of preserving Fish.</em>&mdash;When the Russians
desire to keep fish perfectly fresh, to be carried a long
journey in a hot climate, they dip them into hot bees'-wax,
which acts like an air-tight covering. In this way they are
taken to Malta, even sweet in summer.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_VII" id="PART_VII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART VII.</a></h2>

<h3>MANY THINGS.</h3>

<p class="hsumm"><em>Choice and Cheap Cookery&mdash;New Receipts&mdash;Southern Dishes&mdash;Gumbo,
&amp;c.&mdash;Home-made Wines, &amp;c.&mdash;Dairy&mdash;Coloring&mdash;Diet&mdash;Health, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p>1159. <em>To preserve Ginger.</em>&mdash;Take green ginger, pare it with
a sharp knife, and then throw it into cold water as pared, to
keep it white; then boil it till tender, in three waters, at each
change putting the ginger into cold water. For seven pounds
of ginger, clarify eight pounds of refined sugar; when cold,
drain the ginger, and put it into a pan, with enough of the syrup
to cover it, and let it stand two days; then pour the syrup to
the remainder of the sugar, and boil it some time; when cold,
pour it on the ginger again, and set it by for three days; then
boil the syrup again, and pour it hot over the ginger. Proceed
thus till you find the ginger rich and tender, and the syrup is
highly flavored. If you put the syrup on hot at first, or if too
rich, the ginger will shrink, and not take the sugar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1160. <em>Orange Syrup.</em>&mdash;Is so easily made, and can be used so
constantly with advantage, that no housekeeper should be without
it. Select ripe and thin-skinned fruit; squeeze the juice
through a sieve; to every pint, add a pound a half of powdered
sugar; boil it slowly, and skim as long as any scum rises; you
may then take it off, let it grow cold, and bottle it off. Be
sure to secure the corks well. Two table-spoonfuls of this syrup,
mixed in melted butter, make an admirable sauce for a plum
or butter-pudding; and it imparts a fine flavor to custards.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1161. <em>Apple or Quince Jelly.</em>&mdash;Pare, quarter, and core the
apples; put them in a sauce-pan, with enough water to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
them only; let them boil five minutes; put them in a bag, and
let them drain until the next day. To one pint of juice, put
one pound of sugar, and boil it from fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

<p>[<em>Cranberry Jelly may be made in the same way.</em>]</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1162. <em>Brandy Cherries.</em>&mdash;Take the nicest carnation cherries,
and trim them, leaving a short stem to keep in the juice;
wash and wipe them tenderly, and put them into wide-mouthed
bottles. Make a good syrup, and, when it is nearly done, add
a pint and a half of French brandy to one pint of syrup; mix it
thoroughly, and, when cold, pour it over the cherries. If carefully
sealed, the fruit will be good for years.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1163. <em>Brandy Peaches.</em>&mdash;Drop the peaches in weak, boiling
lye; let them remain till the skin can be wiped off; make a
thin syrup, and let it cover the fruit; boil the fruit till they can
be pierced with a straw; take it out; make a very rich syrup,
and add, after it is taken from the fire, and while it is still hot,
an equal quantity of brandy. Pour this, while it is still warm,
over the peaches in the jar. They must be covered with it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1164. <em>Brandied Peaches&mdash;an excellent way.</em>&mdash;After having
removed the skin in the usual manner, by using <em>lye</em>, and throwing
them in cold water, weigh the peaches, and put them in a
stone jar&mdash;allowing room at the top for three-quarters of a
pound of sugar for each pound of peaches; then pour over
enough white brandy to cover the fruit. Set the jar in a pot of
cold water, and let it remain over the fire till the <em>brandy</em> comes
to a scald. When they are cold, they may either be put in
glass jars, and tied down with bladder, or left in the same jar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1165. <em>Tomato Catchup.</em>&mdash;To one gallon of skinned tomatoes,
add four table-spoonfuls of salt; four table-spoonfuls of black
pepper, ground fine; half a table-spoonful of allspice, ground
fine; three table-spoonfuls of mustard; eight pods of red pepper.
Simmer it slowly in sharp vinegar, in a pewter vessel,
three or four hours; then strain it through a wire-sieve, and
bottle it up. When cold, seal up the corks, and it will last for
years.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1166. <em>Green Tomato Pickle.</em>&mdash;Cut in thin slices one peck of
green tomatoes; sprinkle them with salt, and let them stand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
day or two. Slice ten or twelve small onions. Mix together
one bottle or small tin box of mustard; half an ounce of mustard-seed;
one ounce of cloves; one ounce of pimento; two
ounces of turmeric. Put in the kettle a layer of tomatoes, then
one of onions and spice, till all are in. Cover it with good
vinegar, and let it simmer till the tomatoes are quite clear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1167. <em>French Mustard.</em>&mdash;Put on a plate, one ounce of the
best powdered mustard; a salt-spoonful of salt; a few leaves
of tarragon; and a clove of garlic, minced fine. Pour on it, by
degrees, sufficient vinegar to dilute it to the proper consistency;
about a wine-glassful; mix it with a wooden spoon. Do not
use it in less than twenty-four hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1168. <em>India Pickle.</em> (<em>E. R.</em>)&mdash;Put two hundred gherkins,
three pints of small onions, one quart of nasturtiums, one quart
of radish-pods, 1 quartern of string-beans, six cauliflowers, and
two hard, white cabbages, sliced, into a pan, and sprinkle them
with salt&mdash;the onions having been previously peeled, and laid
in salt and water for a week, to take off their strength. Then,
after a day or two, take them out of the pan, and dry them
thoroughly in a warm place, in the shade: they must be spread
out separately. To two gallons of vinegar, put one ounce and
a half of allspice, the same of long pepper and of white, and
two ounces of ginger, tied up in muslin bags. When cold, mix
with the vinegar one pound and a half of flour of mustard, and
two table-spoonfuls of Cayenne pepper. Boil it well together,
and pour it on the pickle. The vegetables mentioned, not being
all procurable at the same time, may be added separately,
at different periods, but they must all undergo the salting and
drying process.</p>

<p>In choosing those vegetables, some discrimination may also
be used. When in season, few things add a higher flavor to
the pickle than the buds and flowers of the elder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1169. <em>Horse-radish.</em>&mdash;Let the horse-radish lie one or two
hours in cold water; then scrape off the skin, grate it, and
moisten it with vinegar. Serve it with roast meat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1170. <em>Oyster Gumbo.</em>&mdash;Mix well one table-spoonful of flour
and one of lard, and brown the mixture in a frying-pan; take
the liquor of two quarts of oysters, set it on the fire, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
it boils, add the browned flour with some chopped leeks and parsley;
then put in the oysters, and let the whole simmer for fifteen
minutes; next sift into it a table-spoonful and a half of powdered
sassafras, to give it the fillet; leave it two or three minutes longer
on the fire, and serve it very hot. No spices, but black pepper.
This dish will require more or less time to prepare, according
to the ingredients of which it is to be composed. For
chicken or turkey gumbo, the fowl must first be fricasseed.
Any good cook will understand how to make a piquante and palatable
stock, of whatever she may select for her gumbo.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1171. <em>Mayonnaise.</em>&mdash;Roast a pair of chickens or a turkey, in
the morning, and put them away to settle the juices. Immediately
before serving the dish, carve the fowls, and put them
compactly into a dish; take the yolks of six eggs, and pour, in
a very fine and continued stream upon them, half a bottle of
olive oil, and stir the eggs one way, till they are creamed; then
put half a tea-spoonful of vinegar into this dressing, and having
put pepper, salt, and a little vinegar on the fowl, pour the
dressing over it, and arrange all over it bunches of cool, fresh
lettuce. Garnish with hard eggs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1172. <em>Jambalaya</em>&mdash;Cut up, and stew till half done, a fowl,
brown or white; then add rice, and a piece of ham well minced;
this must be left on the fire till the rice has taken up the liquid;
the roundness of the grain must be preserved, yet the dish must
not be hard and dry. It is served in a heap, on a flat dish.
Pepper and salt the only seasoning.</p>

<p>Southern children are very fond of this essentially home-dish.
It is said to be of Indian origin. Wholesome as it is palatable,
it makes part of almost every Creole dinner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1173. <em>Imitation of Mock Turtle.</em>&mdash;Put into a pan a knuckle
of veal, two fine cow-heels or two calf's feet, two onions, a few
cloves, peppers, berries of allspice, mace, and sweet herbs; cover
them with water, then tie a thick paper over the pan, and set
it in an oven for three hours. When cold, take off the fat very
nicely; cut the meat and feet into bits an inch and a half
square; remove the bones and coarse parts, and then put the rest
on to warm, with a large spoonful of walnut and one of mushroom
catchup, half a pint of sherry or Madeira wine, a little
mushroom-powder, and the jelly of the meat. When hot, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
wants any more seasoning, add some; and serve with hard
eggs, forcemeat balls, a squeeze of lemon, and a spoonful of
soy. This is a very easy way, and the dish is excellent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1174. <em>Oyster Sausages.</em>&mdash;Beard, rinse well in their strained
liquor, and mince, but not finely, three dozen and a half of
plump oysters, and mix them with ten ounces of fine bread-crumbs,
and ten of beef-suet chopped extremely small; add a
salt-spoonful of salt, and one of pepper, or less than half the
quantity of cayenne, twice as much pounded mace, and the third
of a small nutmeg grated; moisten the whole with two unbeaten
eggs, or with the yolks only of three, and a dessert-spoonful of
the whites. When these ingredients have been well worked together,
and are perfectly blended, set the mixture in a cool place
for two or three hours before it is used; make it into the form
of small sausages or sausage-cakes, flour and fry them in butter,
of a fine light brown; or throw them into boiling water for
three minutes, drain, and let them become cold; dip them into
egg and bread-crumbs, and broil them gently until they are
lightly colored. A small bit should be cooked and tasted before
the whole is put aside, that the seasoning may be heightened
if required. The sausages thus made are very good.</p>

<p>Small plump oysters, three dozen and a half; bread-crumbs,
ten ounces; beef-suet, ten ounces; seasoning of salt, cayenne,
pounded mace, and nutmeg; unbeaten eggs, two, or yolks of
three.</p>

<p><em>Obs.</em>&mdash;The fingers should be well floured for making up these
sausages.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1175. <em>New England Chowder.</em>&mdash;Have a good haddock, cod,
or any other solid fish, cut it in pieces three inches square, put
a pound of fat salt pork in strips into the pot, set it on hot
coals, and fry out the oil. Take out the pork, and put in a
layer of fish, over that a layer of onions in slices, then a layer
of fish with slips of fat salt pork, then another layer of onions,
and so on alternately, until your fish is consumed. Mix some
flour with as much water as will fill the pot; season with black
pepper and salt to your taste, and boil it for half an hour.
Have ready some crackers soaked in water till they are a little
softened; throw them into your chowder five minutes before
you take it up. Serve in a tureen.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1176. <em>Curing Hams&mdash;the Newbold Receipt.</em>&mdash;Take seven
pounds coarse salt, five pounds brown sugar, two ounces pearl-ash,
4 gallons of water. Boil all together, and scum the pickle
well when cold. Put it on the meat. Hams remain in it eight
weeks&mdash;beef three weeks. The above is for one hundred and
ninety pounds weight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1177. <em>A Pickle that will keep for years, for hams, tongues, or
beef, if boiled and skimmed between each parcel of them.</em>&mdash;To two
gallons of spring water put two pounds of coarse sugar, two
pounds of bay and two and a half pounds of common salt, and
half a pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan that will
hold four gallons, and with a cover that will fit close. Keep
the beef or hams as long as they will bear before you put them
into the pickle; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan,
from which they must drain. Rub the hams, &amp;c., well with
the pickle, and pack them in close, putting as much as the pan
will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is
not to be boiled at first. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a
large one three weeks; a tongue twelve days, and beef in proportion
to its size. They will eat well out of the pickle without
drying. When they are to be dried, let each piece be
drained over the pan; and when it will drop no longer, take a
clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours will
smoke them, and there should be only a little sawdust and wet
straw burnt to do this; but if put into a baker's chimney, sew
them in a coarse cloth, and hang them a week. Add two pounds
of common salt and two pints of water every time you boil the
liquor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1178. <em>To smoke Hams and Fish on a small scale.</em>&mdash;Drive the
ends out of an old hogshead or barrel; place this over a heap
of sawdust of green hard wood, in which a bar of red-hot iron
is buried; or take corn-cobs, which make the best smoke;
place them in a clean iron kettle, the bottom of which is covered
with burning coals; hang the hams, tongues, fish, &amp;c., on
sticks across the cask, and cover it, but not closely, that the
cobs or sawdust may smoulder slowly, but not burn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1179. <em>Onion Sauce.</em>&mdash;Peel the onions, and boil them tender;
squeeze the water from them; chop them; and pour on them
butter that has been carefully incited, together with a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
good milk, instead of water. Boil it up once. A turnip boiled
with the onions, makes them milder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1180. <em>Sauce Robert.</em>&mdash;Cut into small dice, four or five large
onions, and brown them in a stew-pan, with three ounces of
butter, and a dessert-spoonful of flour. When of a deep yellow-brown,
pour to them half a pint of beef or of veal-gravy,
and let them simmer for fifteen minutes; skim the sauce; add
a seasoning of salt and pepper, and, at the moment of serving,
mix in a dessert-spoonful of made-mustard.</p>

<p>Large onions, four or five; butter, three ounces; flour, a dessert-spoonful:
ten to fifteen minutes. Gravy, half a pint: fifteen
minutes. Mustard, a dessert-spoonful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1181. <em>Tomato Sauce.</em>&mdash;Crush half a dozen, more or less, of
very ripe, red tomatoes; pick out the seeds, and squeeze the
water from them; put them into a stew-pan, with two or three
finely-sliced shalots, and a little gravy: simmer till nearly
dry; when add half a pint of brown sauce, and simmer twenty
minutes longer; then rub it through a tammy into a clean
stew-pan; season with Cayenne pepper and salt, a little glaze,
and lemon-juice; simmer a few minutes, and serve. Tarragon
or Chili vinegar are sometimes added; and sliced onions may
be substituted for the shalots.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1182. <em>Brown Caper Sauce.</em>&mdash;Thicken half a pint of good veal
or beef-gravy, as directed for Sauce-Tournée; and add to it
two table-spoonfuls of capers, and a dessert-spoonful of the
pickle-liquor, or of Chili vinegar, with some Cayenne, if the
former be used, and a proper seasoning of salt.</p>

<p>Thickened veal, or beef-gravy, half a pint; capers, two
table-spoonfuls; caper liquor, or Chili vinegar, one dessert-spoonful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1183. <em>Horse-radish Sauce.</em>&mdash;Scrape, finely, a stick of horse-radish
into about half a pint of brown sauce and a gravy-spoonful
of vinegar; simmer, and season with salt and sugar. This
sauce is eaten with hot roast beef.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1184. <em>Sauce for cold Roast Beef.</em>&mdash;Mix scraped horse-radish,
made-mustard, and vinegar, and sweeten with white sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1185. <em>Mint Sauce.</em>&mdash;Mix vinegar and brown sugar, and let
it stand at least an hour; then add chopped mint, and stir together.
It should be very sweet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1186. <em>Mild Mustard.</em>&mdash;Mustard, for instant use, should be
mixed with milk, to which a spoonful or two of very thin cream
may be added.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1187. <em>Mustard, the common way.</em>&mdash;The great art of mixing
mustard, is to have it perfectly smooth, and of a proper consistency.
The liquid with which it is moistened, should be
added to it in small quantities, and the mustard should be well
rubbed, and beaten with a spoon. Mix half a tea-spoonful of
salt with two ounces of the flour of mustard, and stir to them,
by degrees, sufficient boiling water to reduce it to the appearance
of a thick batter. Do not put it into the mustard-glass
until cold. Some persons like half a tea-spoonful of sugar, in
the finest powder, mixed with it. It ought to be sufficiently
diluted always to drop easily from the spoon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1188. <em>Parsley and Butter.</em>&mdash;Scald a large handful of parsley
in boiling water that has some salt in it; when tender, chop it
fine, and stir it into some rather thick melted butter. There
should be sufficient parsley to make the sauce green; and the
parsley should not be put to the melted butter until about to
be served, otherwise it will turn brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1189. <em>To make Sage and Onion Stuffing, for Roast Pork,
Geese, Ducks, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;To make this stuffing, take two middling-sized
onions, peel them, and boil them for about ten minutes
in plenty of water; next take as much dry sage-leaves, as, when
rubbed into powder and sifted through the top of your flour-dredger,
will fill a table-spoon. When the onion has boiled
about ten minutes, squeeze it dry, chop it fine, and mix it with
the crumbled sage; then add to them a tea-cupful of stale,
white bread-crumbs, with a tea-spoonful of black pepper, a very
little pinch of Cayenne, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Mix all
well together, and it is ready.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1190. <em>Sippets of Bread, for Garnishing.</em>&mdash;Cut the crumb of
a stale loaf in slices a quarter of an inch thick: form them into
diamonds or half-diamonds, or in any other way: fry them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
fresh butter. Dry them well, and place them around the dish
to be garnished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1191. <em>Seasoning for Stuffing.</em>&mdash;One pound of salt, dried and
sifted; half an ounce of ground white pepper; two ounces of
dried thyme; one ounce of dried marjoram; and one ounce of
nutmeg. When this seasoning is used, parsley only is required
to be chopped in sufficient quantity to make the stuffing green.
The proportions are&mdash;half a pound of bread-crumbs; three
eggs; a quarter of a pound of suet; half an ounce of seasoning;
and the peel of half a lemon, grated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1192. <em>White Bread-Crumbs.</em>&mdash;Put the crumb of very white
bread into a slow oven or screen, and let it dry without color;
beat and sift it; keep it in a close-covered pan in a dry, warm
place: everything looks well, done with it. The crust may be
dried, beaten, and sifted, for frying and garnishing.</p>

<p>When crumbs are not prepared till wanted, the bread is
never in a proper condition; so that the crumbs are not only
coarse and vulgar, but a sponge for fat, which shows bad taste,
as well as being wasteful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1193. <em>Panada.</em>&mdash;Is indispensable in making good farce of any
kind; it is even better for it than Naples' biscuit, and is made
as follows:&mdash;Steep a sufficient quantity of good stale bread-crumb
in cream or stock; set it over the fire in a sauce-pan,
and work it with a wooden spoon till it is as smooth and dry
as a stiff paste: let it cool, and beat it with a yolk or two,
according to the quantity, in a mortar: it is then ready to be
put into all kinds of farces.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>CAKES, BREAD, PIES, AND PUDDINGS.</h4>

<p>1194. <em>Wine Crust for Cakes or Pastry&mdash;a foreign Receipt.</em>&mdash;Pour
gradually to the well-beaten yolks of three fresh eggs,
cleared from the specks, a quarter of a pint of light white wine
(Marsala will serve for the purpose well enough), stirring them
briskly as it is added; throw in half a salt-spoonful of salt, and
an ounce and a half of pounded sugar; and when this last is
dissolved, or nearly so, add the mixture to as much flour as
will be required to form a smooth, firm paste: about three-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of a pound will be sufficient, unless the eggs should
be of an unusual size. Roll it out, cut it asunder, and spread
one half with eight ounces of butter, cut small; lay the other
half of the paste upon it, and roll them together as lightly as
possible; turn the paste on the board, and fold the two ends
over each other, so as to make the whole of equal thickness;
roll it quite thin, and repeat the folding once or twice, touching
the paste in doing it as little as can be, and rolling it <em>very</em>
lightly. It may be used for any kind of sweet pastry; or it
may be served in the form of cakes, either iced or plain; these
again may be adapted to the second course, by spreading the
under-sides of one half with rich preserve, and pressing the others
on them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1195. <em>Pic-nic Biscuits.</em>&mdash;Work, very small, two ounces of
fresh butter into a pound of flour; reduce to the finest powder,
and mix, intimately, half a salt-spoonful of very pure carbonate
of soda (Howard's is the best), with two ounces of sugar; mingle
these thoroughly with the flour, and make up the paste with
a few spoonfuls of milk; it will require scarcely a quarter of a
pint. Knead it very smooth, roll it a quarter of an inch thick,
cut it in rounds about the size of the top of a <em>small</em> wine-glass;
roll these out thin, prick them well, lay them on lightly-floured
tins, and bake them in a gentle oven until they are crisp quite
through. As soon as they are cold put them into dry canisters.
The sugar can be omitted at pleasure. If thin cream
be used instead of milk, in making the paste, it will much
enrich the biscuits; but this would often not be considered an
improvement, as plain simple biscuits are generally most in
favor.</p>

<p>Carraway seeds or ginger can be added, to vary these at
pleasure. The proportion of soda used should be too small to
be perceptible, even to the taste: it will be no disadvantage to
use milk with it which is slightly acid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1196. <em>A good Soda Cake.</em>&mdash;Rub half a pound of good butter
into a pound of fine dry flour, and work it very small; mix
well with these half a pound of sifted sugar, and pour to them
first a quarter of a pint of boiling milk, and next three well-whisked
eggs; add some grated nutmeg, or fresh lemon-rind,
and eight ounces of currants; beat the whole well and lightly
together, and the instant before the cake is moulded and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
into the oven, stir to it a tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda in
the finest powder. Bake it from an hour to an hour and a
quarter, or divide it in two, and allow from half to three-quarters
of an hour for each cake.</p>

<p>Flour, one pound; butter, three ounces; sugar, eight ounces,
milk, full quarter-pint; eggs, three; currants, half a pound;
carbonate of soda, one tea-spoonful; one hour to one and a
half. Or, divided, a half to three-quarters of an hour&mdash;moderate
oven.</p>

<p><em>Obs.</em>&mdash;This, if well made, resembles a pound-cake, but is
much more wholesome. It is very good with two ounces less
of butter, and with caraway-seeds or candied orange or citron
substituted for the currants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1197. <em>To make Fine Pancakes, Fried without Butter or Lard.</em>&mdash;Take
a pint of cream and six new-laid eggs; beat them well
together; put in a quarter of a pound of sugar and one nutmeg
or a little beaten mace&mdash;which you please, and so much as
will thicken&mdash;almost as much as ordinary pancake flour batter;
your pan must be heated reasonably hot, and wiped with a
clean cloth; this done, spread your batter thin over it, and fry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1198. <em>To make Loaves of Cheese-curd.</em>&mdash;Take a porringer full
of curds, and four eggs, whites and yolks, and as much flour as
will make it stiff; then take a little ginger, nutmeg, and some
salt; make them into loaves, and set them into an oven with a
quick heat; when they begin to change color, take them out,
and put melted butter to them, and some sack, and good store
of sugar; and so serve.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1199. <em>Cheap Ginger Biscuits.</em>&mdash;Work into quite small
crumbs three ounces of good butter, with two pounds of flour;
then add three ounces of pounded sugar and two of ginger, in
fine powder, and knead them into a stiff paste, with new milk.
Roll it thin, cut out the biscuits with a cutter, and bake them
in a slow oven until they are crisp quite through, but keep
them of a pale color. A couple of eggs are sometimes mixed
with the milk for them, but are no material improvement; an
additional ounce of sugar may be used when a sweeter biscuit
is liked. To make good ginger <em>cakes</em>, increase the butter to six
ounces, and the sugar to eight, for each pound of flour, and wet
the ingredients into a paste with eggs; a little lemon-grate will
give it an agreeable flavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Biscuits&mdash;flour, two pounds; butter, three ounces; pounded
sugar, three ounces; ginger, two ounces.</p>

<p>Cakes&mdash;flour, one pound; butter, six ounces; sugar, eight
ounces; ginger, one ounce; three to four eggs; rind of half a
lemon.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1200. <em>Ginger Snaps.</em>&mdash;Beat together half a pound of butter,
and half a pound of sugar; mix with them half a pint of molasses,
half a tea-cupful of ginger, and one pound and a half of
flour.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1201. <em>Gingerbread.</em>&mdash;Mix together three and a half pounds
of flour; three-quarters of a pound of butter; one pound of
sugar; one pint of molasses; a quarter of a pound of ginger,
and some ground orange-peel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1202. <em>Raspberry Cakes.</em>&mdash;Take any quantity of fruit you
please, weigh and boil it, and when mashed, and the liquor is
washed, add as much sugar as was equal in weight to the raw
fruit. Mix it very well <em>off</em> the fire till the whole is dissolved,
then lay it on plates, and dry it in the sun. When the top
part dries, cut it off into small cakes, and turn them on a fresh
plate. When dry, put the whole in boxes, with layers of
paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1203. <em>Rock Cakes.</em>&mdash;Mix together one pound of flour; half
a pound of sugar; half a pound of butter; half a pound of
currants or cherries, and four eggs, leaving out the whites of
two; a little wine and candied lemon-peel are a great improvement.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1204. <em>Cup Cakes.</em>&mdash;Mix together five cups of flour; three
cups of sugar; one cup of butter; one cup of milk; three eggs,
well beaten; one wine-glass of wine; one of brandy, and a little
cinnamon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1205. <em>Jumbles.</em>&mdash;Take one pound of loaf-sugar, pounded fine;
one pound and a quarter of flour; three-quarters of a pound of
butter; four eggs, beaten light, and a little rose-water and
spice; mix them well, and roll them in sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1206. <em>Sponge Cake.</em>&mdash;Take the weight of the eggs in sugar;
half their weight in flour, well sifted; to twelve eggs, add the
grated rind of three lemons, and the juice of two. Beat the
eggs carefully, white and yolks separately, before they are
used. Stir the materials thoroughly together, and bake in a
quick oven.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1207. <em>Apple Fritters.</em>&mdash;Pare and core some fine large pippins,
and cut them into round slices. Soak them in wine, sugar,
and nutmeg, for two or three hours. Make a batter of four
eggs; a table-spoonful of rose-water; a table-spoonful of wine;
a table-spoonful of milk; thicken with enough flour, stirred in
by degrees, to make a batter; mix it two or three hours before
it is wanted, that it may be light. Heat some butter in a frying
pan; dip each slice of apple separately in the batter, and
fry them brown; sift pounded sugar, and grate nutmeg over
them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1208. <em>A Charlotte Russe.</em>&mdash;It is very difficult to prepare this
delicate dish, and we advise all inexperienced house-keepers
not to undertake it without the superintendence of a professed
cook.</p>

<p>Extract the flavor from a vanilla-bean, by boiling it in half
a pint of milk. The milk must then be strained; and, when
cold, mix with it a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar. Beat the
yolks of four eggs very light, and stir them into the mixture.
Heat it over the fire for five minutes, until it becomes a custard,
but take great care that it does not boil. Boil an ounce
of isinglass with a pint of water. The isinglass must be thoroughly
dissolved before it is fit for use, and one-half of the
water boiled away. The custard being cold, drain the isinglass
into it, and stir them hard together. Leave them to cool,
while you prepare the rest of the mixture. Whip a quart of
cream to a froth, (the cream should be rich,) and mix it with
the custard; in whipping the cream, great care should be taken
to make it quite light; the safest way is, to remove the froth
as fast as it gathers, with a strainer, until the whole is whipped.</p>

<p>Take two round slices of almond sponge-cake; glaze them
with the beaten white of egg mixed with sugar. Lay one on
the bottom of a circular mould, and reserve the other for the
top.</p>

<p>Cut some more sponge-cake into long pieces; glaze them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
carefully with the egg, and line the sides of the mould with
them. Each piece should lap a little over the other, or the
form will not be perfect. The custard will by this time be just
beginning to congeal; pour it gently into the mould, and cover
the top with the piece of cake which has already been prepared.
The cake around the sides must be trimmed evenly, so that
the upper piece will fit without leaving any vacancies.</p>

<p>Pound some ice, and throw it into a tub, covering it well
with coarse salt. The mould should then be set into the midst
of this ice, and must remain there an hour. Prepare an icing
with powdered sugar and the beaten white of egg, flavoring it
with lemon-juice, or essence of lemon, orange, or rose-water,
according to the taste. The Charlotte Russe is then turned out
upon a handsome dish, and iced over. It should be moved
about as little as possible; and, to ensure success in preparing
it, the utmost care must be taken to follow the above directions.</p>

<p>At large parties, a Charlotte Russe is as indispensable on the
supper-table as ice-cream.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1209. <em>Batter Pudding.</em>&mdash;Take six ounces of fine flour, a little
salt, and three eggs; beat it up well with a little milk, added
by degrees till the batter is quite smooth: make it the thickness
of cream: put it into a buttered pie-dish, and bake three-quarters
of an hour; or, in a buttered and floured basin, tied
over tight with a cloth: boil one hour and a half or two hours.</p>

<p>Any kind of ripe fruit that you like may be added to the
batter&mdash;only you must make the batter a little stiffer. Blueberries,
or finely-chopped apple, are most usually liked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1210. <em>French Batter, (for frying Vegetables, and for Apple,
Peach, or Orange Fritters.</em>)&mdash;Cut two ounces of good butter
into small bits; pour on it less than a quarter of a pint of boiling
water; and, when it is dissolved, add three-quarters of a
pint of cold water, so that the whole shall not be quite milk-warm:
mix it then by degrees, and very smoothly, with twelve
ounces of fine, dry flour, and a <em>small</em> pinch of salt, if the batter
be for fruit-fritters, but with more, if for meat or vegetables.
Just before it is used, stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten
to a solid froth; but, previously to this, add a little water,
should it appear too thick, as some flour requires more liquid
than others, to bring it to a proper consistency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Butter, two ounces; water, from three-quarters to nearly a
pint; little salt; flour, three-quarters of a pound; whites of
two eggs, beaten to snow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1211. <em>Terrines of Rice, sweet and savory.</em>&mdash;Wash four ounces
of Carolina rice in several waters, and leave it to soak for ten
minutes; then put it into a common Nottingham jar, with a
cover, and in shape, larger, considerably, in the middle than at
the top&mdash;as those of narrower form and proportionably greater
height will not answer so well. This jar may contain one quart
or two, as the stove-oven in which it is to be placed, may permit.
The smaller size has, on compulsion, been used for the
present and following receipts&mdash;the iron-plate in the centre of
the only oven which the writer had at command, preventing
a larger one from standing in it. Pour on the rice an exact pint
of new milk; add two ounces of pounded sugar, the slightest
pinch of salt, and any flavor which may be liked. Stir the
whole well for a minute or two; put on the cover of the jar;
make a bit of paste with flour and water, sufficient to form a
wide, thick band; moisten the side which is laid on the jar,
and bind the edges of the cover and the jar together securely
with it; tie brown paper over, and set it into the coolest part
of the oven of the kitchen-range. Bake the rice <em>gently</em> for two
hours and a quarter at the least, and turn the jar half-round
once or twice while it is in the oven. Stir it lightly up, heap it
on a hot dish, and send it to table. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compôte</i> of fresh fruit
is an admirable accompaniment to it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1212. <em>Nutmeg Pudding.</em>&mdash;Pound, fine, two large or three
small nutmegs; melt three pounds of butter, and stir into it
half a pound of loaf-sugar, a little wine, the yolks of five eggs,
well beaten, and the nutmegs. Bake on a puff-paste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1213. <em>Wine Jelly.</em>&mdash;Soak four ounces of gelatine in one quart
of cold water, for half an hour. In the meantime, mix with
two quarts of cold water, six table-spoonfuls of brandy; one
pint of white-wine; six lemons, cut up with the peel on; the
whites and shells of six eggs, the whites slightly beaten, the
shells crushed; three pounds of white sugar: then mix the
gelatine with the other ingredients, and put them over the fire.
Let it boil, without stirring, for twenty minutes. Strain it
through a flannel-bag, without squeezing. Wet the mould in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
cold water. Pour the jelly in, and leave it in a cool place for
three hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1214. <em>Economics.</em>&mdash;It is often a matter of great convenience
as well as of economy, to give a new and presentable form to
the remains of dishes which have already appeared at table:
the following hints may, therefore, be not unacceptable to some
of our readers.</p>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;Calf's-feet jelly and good blanc-mange are excellent
when just melted and mixed together, whether in equal or unequal
proportions. They should be heated only sufficient to
liquify them, or the acid of the jelly might curdle the blanc-mange.
Pour this last, when melted, into a deep earthen bowl,
and add the jelly to it in small portions, whisking them briskly
together as it is thrown in. A small quantity of prepared
cochineal&mdash;which may be procured from a chemist's&mdash;will serve
to improve or to vary the color, when required. Many kinds
of creams and custards also may be blended advantageously
with the blanc-mange, after a little additional isinglass has been
dissolved in it, to give sufficient firmness to the whole. It
must be observed, that, though just liquid, either jelly or blanc-mange
must be as nearly cold as it will become without thickening
and beginning to set, before it is used for this receipt.</p>

<p>A sort of marbled or Mosaic mass is sometimes made by
shaking together, in a mould, remnants of various-colored blanc-manges,
cut nearly of the same size, and then filling it up
with some clear jelly.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;When a small part only of an open tart has been
eaten, divide the remainder equally into triangular slices, place
them at regular intervals round a dish, and then fill the intermediate
spaces, and cover the tart entirely, with slightly-sweetened
and well-drained whipped cream.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1215. <em>Pumpkin Pie.</em>&mdash;Stew the pumpkin dry, and make it
like squash pie, only season rather higher. In the country,
where this <em>real Yankee pie</em> is prepared in perfection, ginger is
almost always used with other spices. There, too, part cream,
instead of milk, is mixed with the pumpkin, which gives it a
richer flavor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1216. <em>Rhubarb Stalks, or Persian Apple</em>&mdash;Is the earliest
ingredient for pies, which the spring offers. The skin should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
be carefully stripped, and the stalks cut into small bits, and
stewed very tender. These are dear pies, for they take an
enormous quantity of sugar: seasoned like apple pies. Gooseberries,
currants, &amp;c., are stewed, sweetened, and seasoned like
apple pies, in proportions suited to the sweetness of the fruit;
there is no way to judge but by your own taste. Always remember,
it is more easy to add seasoning, than to diminish it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1217. <em>Superlative Mince-meat, for Pies.</em>&mdash;Take four large lemons,
with their weight of golden pippins, pared and cored, of jar-raisins,
currants, candied citron and orange-rind, and the finest
suet, and a fourth-part more of pounded sugar. Boil the lemons
tender, chop them small; but be careful first to extract all the
pips; add them to the other ingredients, after all have been
prepared with great nicety, and mix the whole <em>well</em> with from
three to four glasses of good brandy. Apportion salt and spice
by the preceding receipt. We think that the weight of one
lemon, in meat, improves this mixture; or, in lieu of it, a small
quantity of crushed macaroons, added just before it is baked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1218. <em>Rolls.</em>&mdash;Rub into a pound of sifted flour, two ounces
of butter; beat the whites of three eggs to a froth, and add
a table-spoonful of good yeast, a little salt, and sufficient warm
milk to make a stiff dough. Cover and put it where it will
be kept warm, and it will rise in an hour. Then make it into
rolls, or round cakes; put them on a floured tin, and bake in
a quick oven or stove. They will be done in ten or fifteen
minutes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1219. <em>To make Yeast in the Turkish manner.</em>&mdash;Take a small
tea-cupful of split or bruised peas, and pour on it a pint of boiling
water, and set it in a vessel all night on the hearth, or any
warm place. The next morning the water will have a froth on
it, and be good yeast, and will make as much bread as two
quartern loaves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1220. <em>Dyspepsia Bread.</em>&mdash;The following receipt for making
bread, has proved highly salutary to persons afflicted with
dyspepsia, viz:&mdash;Three quarts unbolted wheat meal; one quart
soft water, warm, but not hot; one gill of fresh yeast; one gill
of molasses, or not, as may suit the taste; one teaspoonful of
saleratus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>This will make two loaves, and should remain in the oven
at least one hour; and when taken out, placed where they will
cool gradually. Dyspepsia crackers can be made with unbolted
flour, water, and saleratus.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1221. <em>Unfermented Bread.</em>&mdash;This keeps moist longer than
bread made with yeast, and is more sweet and digestible. The
brown bread made in this way is particularly recommended
for dyspeptics. Take four pounds of flour, half an ounce avoirdupois
of muriatic acid; the same of carbonate of soda; about
a quart of water. First mix the soda and flour well together
by rubbing in a pan; pour the acid into the water, and stir it
well together. Mix all together to the required consistence and
bake in a hot oven immediately. If instead of flour, unbolted
meal should be used, take three pounds of meal; half an ounce
avoirdupois of muriatic acid; the same of carbonate of soda;
and water enough to make it of a proper consistence. Mix in
the same way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1222. <em>Rice Caudle.</em>&mdash;When the water boils, pour into it some
ground rice mixed with a little cold water; when of a proper
consistency, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass
of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth.</p>

<p><em>Or</em>:&mdash;Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it,
and put two spoonfuls of the rice into a pint and a quarter of
milk; simmer till it will pulp through a sieve, then put the
pulp and milk into the saucepan, with a bruised clove, and a
bit of white sugar. Simmer ten minutes: if too thick, add a
spoonful or two of milk, and serve with thin toast.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1223.&mdash;<em>Johnny Cakes.</em>&mdash;Sift a quart of corn meal into a pan;
make a hole in the middle, and pour in a pint of warm water.
Mix the meal and water gradually into a batter, adding a tea-spoonful
of salt; beat it very quickly, and for a long time, till
it becomes quite light; then spread it thick and even on a stout
piece of smooth board; place it upright on the hearth before a
clear fire, with something to support the board behind, and bake
it well; cut it into squares, and split and butter them hot.</p>

<p>They may also be made with a quart of milk, three eggs, one
tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda, and one tea-cupful of wheaten
flour; add Indian corn-meal sufficient to make a batter like that
of pancakes, and either bake it in buttered pans, or upon a
griddle, and eat them with butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1224. <em>Green Corn.</em>&mdash;Must be boiled in clear water, with salt,
from twenty minutes to half an hour; if old, it will require a
longer time. It must be sent to table directly it is done, as it
loses its sweetness by either boiling after it is done, or standing
when dished.</p>

<p>(A tea-spoonful of saleratus boiled with corn is said to prevent
sickness.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1225. <em>Corn Oysters.</em>&mdash;One pint of grated green corn, one
cup of flour, one dessert-spoonful of salt, one tea-spoonful of
pepper, one egg.</p>

<p>Mix the ingredients together, drop, and fry them in hot lard.
In taste they resemble fried oysters. They are an excellent
relish for breakfast, and a good side-dish for dinner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1226. <em>Sackatash, or Corn and Beans.</em>&mdash;Boil three pints of
shelled beans, or a quarter of a peck of string beans, half an
hour, pour off the water. Cut the corn off of four dozen ears&mdash;put
it in the pot among the beans, add salt and pepper, and
cover them with boiling water&mdash;boil all together twenty minutes.
Rub flour into a large piece of butter and stir it in, then let it
boil up once. Pour it into your tureen and send it to table.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1227. <em>Winter Sackatash.</em>&mdash;As in winter the beans and corn
are both dried, they will have to be soaked over night. Par-boil
the beans in one or two waters, then add the corn, and boil
all together until the beans are boiled to pieces, which will be
several hours. Add a small piece of loaf sugar. Before dishing
it for table, mix a large piece of butter with flour, stir it in
and let it boil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1228. <em>To make Curry Powders.</em>&mdash;Take one ounce of ginger,
the same of coriander-seed, half an ounce of cayenne pepper,
and two ounces of fine pale turmeric; these ingredients to be
pounded separately to a fine powder, and then warmed by the
fire, and mixed together. Put the powder into a wide-mouthed
bottle, cork it well down, and put it into a dry place.</p>

<p>Those who dislike the flavor of turmeric may substitute saffron.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1229. <em>To prepare a Curry.</em>&mdash;The meat should be fresh and
free from bone. Cut it into pieces which can be easily served.
To each pound of meat add a table-spoonful of curry powder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and about half the quantity of flour, and a little salt; mix these
together, and rub a portion of it upon the meat before it is fried,
the remainder afterwards. Fry the meat in a little butter.
Fry onions a light brown, with a clove of garlic if approved;
drain the fat from both the meat and onions; put them into a
stewpan, and cover with boiling water; stew for twenty minutes,
then rub the remainder of the powder smooth with a little cold
water, add it, and let it stew for an hour, or according to the
time necessary for the meat to be well done. If no other acid
is used, stir in a little lemon-juice just before serving: place it
in the centre of the dish, and put carefully boiled rice round it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1230. <em>Lord Clive's Curry.</em>&mdash;Slice six onions, one green apple,
and a clove of garlic; stew them in a little good stock until
they will pulp, then add one tea-spoonful of curry-powder, a
few table-spoonfuls of stock, a little salt, and a little cayenne
pepper, half a salt-spoonful of each; stew in this gravy any
kind of meat cut into small pieces, adding a piece of butter,
the size of a walnut, rolled in flour.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1231. <em>To free Molasses from its sharp taste, and to render
it fit to be used instead of Sugar.</em>&mdash;Take twenty-four pounds
of molasses, twenty-four pounds of water, and six pounds of
charcoal, coarsely pulverized: mix them in a kettle, and boil
the whole over a slow wood fire. When the mixture has boiled
half an hour, pour it into a flat vessel, in order that the charcoal
may subside to the bottom: then pour off the liquid, and place
it over the fire once more, that the superfluous water may evaporate,
and the molasses be brought to their former consistence.
Twenty-four pounds of molasses will produce twenty-four
pounds of syrup.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1232. <em>To make Apple Molasses.</em>&mdash;Take new sweet cider just
from the press, made from sweet apples, and boil it down as
thick as West India molasses. It should be boiled in brass,
and not burned, as that would injure the flavor. It will keep
in the cellar, and is said to be as good, and for many purposes
better than West India molasses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1233. <em>To dress Chestnuts for Dessert.</em>&mdash;Let them be well
roasted, and the husks taken off. Dissolve a quarter pound of
sugar in a wine-glassful of water, and the juice of a lemon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Put this and the chestnuts into a saucepan over a slow fire for
ten minutes; add sufficient orange-flower water to flavor the
syrup; serve in a deep dish, and grate sugar over them. To
be handed round whilst quite hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1234. <em>To improve Claret Wine when acid.</em>&mdash;Place the cask
on a stand for refining, put into it a quarter pound of chalk
broken into small pieces. Let it remain one day, and then refine
with the whites of six eggs, the shells broken, and a handful
of salt; all these are to be mixed with some of the wine,
and then thrown into the cask. The shells are not to be powdered,
but simply crushed in the hand. The wine will be fit for
bottling in two weeks. When bottled, it should be laid on
the side. The bungs to be out as short a time as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1235. <em>To improve Home-made wines.</em>&mdash;When there is a tendency
to acidity in wine, add to it sugar-candy in the proportion
of a pound to every four gallons; dissolve it, and put it into
the cask, incorporating it well.</p>

<p>Poor wines may be improved by the addition of bruised
raisins. If one ounce of powdered roche-alum be put into a cask
of four gallons of wine, it will make it fine and brisk in ten days.
Ripe medlars, or bruised mustard-seed, tied in a bag, will remove
mustiness, or other disagreeable taste.</p>

<p>Pricked wines may be improved, if not recovered, by being
racked off into a cask that has contained the same kind of wine.
The cask should be first matched or sulphured; and, to every
ten gallons of wine, put two ounces of oyster-shell powder, and
half an ounce of bay-salt; stir it, and leave it a few days to
fine; after which, rack it into another cask, also matched.</p>

<p>Burn dry walnuts over a charcoal fire, and when they are
well lit, throw them into the wine, and bung up; in forty-eight
hours they will correct the acidity. One walnut will
suffice for every gallon of wine.</p>

<p>If bottled wine be <em>ropy</em>, shake it for twenty minutes, uncork
it, and pour off the froth or scum, when the rest of the wine
will be drinkable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1236. <em>Casking.</em>&mdash;The casks should be washed with hot salt
and water, then with hot water, and lastly with a portion of
the fermented liquor made to boil.</p>

<p>After the liquor is removed into the cask, it will slowly ferment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and some will evaporate. The cask should, however, be
kept filled near the bung-hole, else the scum cannot be thrown
out.</p>

<p>When the fret subsides, close the bung-hole, and bore a hole
for a peg, to be withdrawn occasionally, else the cask may
burst.</p>

<p>In the following Spring, determine whether you bottle or
keep in wood another year; but wines that have been properly
fermented, and promise well, will be improved by remaining
in the cask another year. Then, if the wine wants rich flavor,
add to twenty gallons, five pounds of sugar-candy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1237. <em>Bottling.</em>&mdash;Brisk wines should be bottled on the approach
of Spring.</p>

<p>If the wine be not fine enough, draw off a quart, in which dissolve
isinglass in the proportion of half an ounce to twenty gallons,
and pour the solution in at the bung-hole. In about three
weeks, the liquor will be sufficiently clear for bottling.</p>

<p>In drawing off, be careful to tap the cask above the lees.
The wine, to be fit for bottling, should be fine and brilliant,
else it will never brighten after. When bottled, it should be
stored in a cool cellar, and the bottles laid on their sides, and
in sawdust; but, on no account set upright.</p>

<p>In making wines, it is a good plan to use two casks, one a
very small one, from which the larger one may be filled up,
during the fermentation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1238. <em>Fining for Wine.</em>&mdash;Put an ounce of isinglass into a
quart jug, with one pint of wine; stir it twice or thrice a day,
and it will soon dissolve; when strain it through a sieve. A
pint of this fining will be sufficient for a cask of twenty
gallons.</p>

<p>When the fining is put into the cask, stir it up with a stick,
taking care not to touch the bottom, so as to disturb the lees.
Fill up the cask, if necessary, bung it down, and in a week
the wine will be fit for bottling.</p>

<p>For white wine only, add and mix, as above, a quarter of a
pint of milk to every gallon of wine. It may also be fined
with the whites of eggs, beaten up with some wine, in the proportion
of four whites to sixteen gallons of wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1239. <em>To sweeten Casks.</em>&mdash;If a cask, after the contents are
drunk out, be well stopped, and the lees be allowed to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
in it till it is again to be used, it will only be necessary to
scald it; taking care, before you fill it, to see that the hoops
are well driven. Should the air get into the cask, it will become
musty, and scalding will not improve it; the surest way
will be then to take out the head of the cask, to be shaved,
then to burn it a little, and scald it for use. Or, put into the
cask some quick lime and cold water, bung it down, shake it
for some time, and then scald it; or, burn a <em>match</em> in it, and
scald it.</p>

<p>Or, mix half a pint of the strongest sulphuric acid in an
open vessel, with a quart of water, put it into the cask, and
roll it well about; next day, add one pound of chalk, bung it
down, and in three or four days the cask should be washed out
with boiling water.</p>

<p>To prepare a match, melt some brimstone, and dip into it a
long narrow piece of coarse linen cloth, or brown paper; when
to be used, set fire to the match, put it in at the bung-hole of
the cask, fastening one end under the bung, and let it remain,
for a few hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1240. <em>A Filtering Bag.</em>&mdash;Will be useful in fining wines: it
may be made of a yard of moderately-fine flannel, laid sloping,
so as to have the bottom very narrow, and the top the full
breadth; strongly sew up the side, and fold and sew the upper
part of the bag about a broad wooden hoop, to be suspended
by a cord fastened in three or four places.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1241. <em>Coloring Wines.</em>&mdash;In the coloring of wines, many substances
have been used, and it is desirable to select such as
may also communicate an agreeable flavor. Red colors are
easily obtained from beet-root, logwood, or the berries of the
elder; and every variety of yellow may be produced by the
use of burnt sugar, which also gives an agreeable bitterness.</p>

<p>There is no end to the materials which have been used to
give a flavor to wine. The flowers of elder, cowslips, clove-pinks,
and mignonette, are well known. The shavings of <em>orris-root</em>,
in the proportion of half an ounce to twenty gallons, will
be found to communicate an agreeable perfume. The shavings
should be tied in a linen bag, and suspended in the cask by a
string, so as to be removable at pleasure, if, upon trial, it is
found that the flavor is likely to be too predominant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1242. <em>To check Fermentation.</em>&mdash;<em>Sulphate of potash</em> will stop
fermentation. <em>One dram</em> is sufficient for a pipe of liquor. It
will be useful to the <em>confectioner</em> to know, that by the use of
the same salt, the fermentation of syrups and preserves may
also be effectually prevented.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1243. <em>Currant Shrub; easily made.</em>&mdash;To every quart of juice,
add one pound of sugar, and one gill of brandy. Bottle and
cork it tight. Do not put it over the fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1244. <em>Damson Wine.</em>&mdash;To four gallons of boiling water, add
a peck of damsons; stir this liquor twice every day. Let it
stand for three days, and then strain the whole through a lawn
sieve. Add nine pounds of loaf sugar, and three spoonsful of
yeast; after it has worked in a tub for three days, turn it into
a cask, and add three quarts of elder syrup. Rack the wine
in a fortnight. Put in two lemons, sliced, a quarter of a pound
of loaf sugar, rubbed on the peel, and two pounds of raisins,
chopped. Stop it close till March, and then bottle it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1245. <em>Red Cherry Wine.</em>&mdash;Strip, when full ripe, any quantity
of the finest red, or Kentish cherries, from their stalks, and
stamp them, in the same manner as apples for cider, till the
stones are broken. Put the whole into a tub, and cover it up
closely for three days and nights; then press it in a cider-press;
put the liquor again into a tub, and let it stand, covered
as before, two days longer. Carefully take off the scum, without
in the smallest degree disturbing the liquor, which is to be
poured off the lees, into a different tub. After it has thus
stood to clear another two days, it must again be cautiously
skimmed, and the clear liquid poured off as before. If the
cherries are, as they ought to be, quite ripe and sweet, a pound
and a half of good sugar will be sufficient for each gallon of
juice, which is to be well stirred in, and the liquor again closely
covered up, without being any more disturbed till the next
day; then pour it carefully from the lees, as before, put it to
stand, in the same manner, another day; and then, with the
like care, pour it off into the cask, or casks, in which it is intended
to be kept. The above process must be often repeated,
should the lees appear gross and likely to make the liquor fret.
When entirely settled, stop it up, for at least seven or eight
months; then, if perfectly fine, put it in bottles; if not, drain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
it off into another vessel, and stop it up for six months longer,
before you venture to bottle it, when it will want only age to
equal, if not exceed, all foreign wines. It will, however, be
best not to drink it till at least ten or twelve months old.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1246. <em>Rich Morella Cherry Wine.</em>&mdash;Having picked off from
their stalks the ripest and soundest morella cherries, bruise
them well, without breaking the stones, and let the whole stand
twenty-four hours in an open vessel. Then press out all the
juice, and for every gallon, add two pounds of fine loaf sugar.
Put this wine into a cask, and when the fermentation ceases, stop
it close. Let it stand three or four months, then bottle it, and
in two months more it will be fit to drink. Some crack the
stones, and hang them, with the bruised kernels, in a bag, from
the bung, while the wine remains in the cask.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1247. <em>Incomparable Apricot Wine.</em>&mdash;Take eight pounds of
ripe apricots, slice them into two gallons of spring water, and
add five pounds of powdered loaf sugar. Boil them together
for some time, without taking off the scum; then skim it off
as it continues to rise, and put it in a clean sieve, over a pan,
to save the liquor which comes from it. When the boiling
liquor is as clear as it can be made from the dross of the
sugar, pour it, with the drainings of the sieve, hot on the kernels
of the apricots, which must be put with the stones into the
pan, where it is intended the wine should be left to cool. Stir
all well together, cover it up closely till it grows quite cool,
and then work it with a toast and yeast. In two or three days,
when it is found to be settled, fine it off into a cask, leaving it
to ferment as long as it will. After it has done working, pour
in a bottle of old hock, mountain, or sherry, and stop it up for
six months; then, if very fine, bottle it, and keep it twelve
months. This is indeed a most delicious wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1248. <em>To detect Sugar of Lead in Wines.</em>&mdash;The tincture of
orpiment converts wine so adulterated to a black color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1249. <em>Orange Wine.</em>&mdash;To ten gallons of water put twenty-eight
pounds of loaf sugar, and the whites of six eggs. Boil
them together for three-quarters of an hour, keeping the liquor
well skimmed all the time, and then pour it hot into a tub, or
large pan, over the peels of fifty Seville oranges. When it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
nearly cold, take three spoonsful of yeast, spread on a piece of
toasted bread, and put in the liquor to make it ferment. After
it has stood two or three days, pour it from the peels into the
cask, with a gallon of orange juice, which takes about a hundred
and twenty oranges. Let it remain in the cask till it has
done hissing, when the fermentation will have ceased. Endeavor
to proportion the size of the cask to the quantity, as it
must be kept filled, so as to work out at the bung-hole. When
the fermentation is over, draw off as much of the wine as will
admit one quart of brandy for every five gallons of wine. It
will be fit to bottle, or drink from the cask, in four or five
months. This wine, if carefully made, according to these plain
directions, will be found exquisitely delicious; and were it
kept four or five years, would far surpass most of the best
foreign wines, as they are usually sold in England.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1250. <em>Red Currant Wine.</em>&mdash;To eight gallons of water add
twenty-four pounds of loaf sugar; boil the syrup and skim it,
till the scum disappears. Have ready, picked from the stalks,
two gallons of red currants, taking care not to bruise them.
Pour the syrup, boiling hot, on the currants. Let it all stand
till nearly cold; then add a teacupful of yeast. Let it ferment
for two days; then strain it through a sieve, into the
cask, and when the fermentation entirely ceases, bung it tight.
It will be ready to bottle at the end of two months. Into
each bottle put a small lump of sugar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1251. <em>Raisin Wine.</em>&mdash;To every gallon of water weigh seven
pounds of raisins; pick them from the stalks, and put them
into a tub; pour the water on the fruit, and let it stand a fortnight
or three weeks, stirring it several times a day. Strain
it, and press the fruit very dry through hair bags, then put it
into a barrel, but do not stop it close. In about four months
rack it, and then put a little fresh fruit, and some brandy, into
the barrel. A quart of brandy, and eight or ten pounds of
fruit, are sufficient for twenty-five or thirty gallons of wine.
When the wine is racked, draw it off into a tub, and pass the
sediment that remains through a flannel bag; the head of the
barrel must then be taken out, and the barrel rinsed with a
little of the wine. After the head is again put in, add the
brandy and fruit. Put the bung in for a little time, but not
very tight. It will be necessary to refine the wine with isinglass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
about three weeks before it is bottled, which should not
be in less than a year. One ounce of isinglass, dissolved in
half a pint of wine, and stirred into the barrel, will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Before the water is poured on the fruit, it should be boiled
with the stalks, and with hops; the latter in the proportion of
a quarter of a pound to every thirty gallons of water. Strain
the liquor, let it grow cold, and then add it to the fruit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1252. <em>Spruce Wine.</em>&mdash;To every gallon of water take a pound
and a half of honey, and half a pound of fine starch. Before
the starch is mixed with the honey-syrup, it must be reduced
to a transparent jelly, by boiling it with part of the water purposely
reserved;&mdash;a quarter of a pound of essence of spruce
must be used to five gallons of water, and when sufficiently
stirred and incorporated, pour the wine into the cask. Then
add a quarter of a pint of good ale-yeast, shake the cask well,
and let it work for three or four days, after which, bung it. It
may be bottled in a few days, and in ten days afterwards, will
be fit to drink. When this wine is bunged, a quarter of an
ounce of isinglass, first dissolved in a little of the warmed
liquor, may be stirred in by way of fining it. In cold weather,
the quantity of yeast should be increased: in warm weather,
very little ferment is requisite.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1253. <em>American Currant Wine.</em>&mdash;To one gallon of currant
juice add two of water; to each gallon of this mixture add
three pounds and a quarter of sugar, a gill of brandy, and a
quarter of an ounce of powdered alum: put the whole into a
clean cask, in March <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'draw of'">draw off</span>, and add another gill of brandy
to each gallon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1254. <em>Rich Mead.</em>&mdash;Mix well the whites of six eggs in twelve
gallons of water; and to this mixture, when it has boiled half an
hour and been well skimmed, add thirty-six pounds of the finest
honey, with the rinds of two dozen lemons. Let them boil
together some little time, and on the liquor's becoming sufficiently
cool, work it with a little ale-yeast. Put it with the
lemon peel into a seasoned barrel, which must be filled up as it
flows over with some of the reserved liquor; and when the hissing
ceases, drive the bung close. After the wine has stood
five or six months, bottle it for use. If intended to be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
several years, put in a pound more honey for every gallon of
water.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1255. <em>Red and White Mead with Raspberries and Currants.</em>&mdash;For
every gallon of wine to be made, take one pound and a
half of honey, half an ounce of tartar, or Bologna argol, and
three-quarters of a pound of fruit. If for white wine, white
argol should be used with white currants; if for red wine, red
argol with red currants or raspberries. Prepare the honey by
mixing it with as much water as will, when added to the juice
of the fruit (allowing for diminution by boiling, &amp;c.), make the
proposed quantity of wine. This being well boiled and clarified,
infuse in it a moderate quantity of rosemary leaves, lavender,
and sweet-brier, and when they have remained for two
days, strain the liquor, and add it to the expressed juice of the
fruit, put in the dissolved argol, stir the whole well together,
and leave it to ferment. In two or three days, put it in a
seasoned barrel; keep filling it up, as the liquor flows over;
and on its ceasing to work, sink in it a muslin bag of Seville
orange and lemon peel, with cinnamon, cloves and nutmegs,
and closely bung the cask. If kept for six months or more in
the wood, and at least nine in bottles, this wine will be excellent,
whether red or white. In a similar way may be made all sorts
of fruit wines, thus substituting honey for sugar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1256. <em>Nectar.</em>&mdash;Take half a pound of raisins of the sun,
chopped, one pound of powdered loaf sugar, two lemons, sliced,
and the peel of one. Put them into an earthen vessel with two
gallons of water, the water having been boiled half an hour;
and put them in while the water is boiling. Let the whole
stand three or four days, stirring it twice a day; then strain it,
and in a fortnight it will be ready for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1257. <em>Syrup of Cloves, Cinnamon, or Mace.</em>&mdash;All these syrups
are made exactly on the same plan.&mdash;Take two ounces of either
cloves, cinnamon, or mace, well pounded, and put it into a pint
of boiling water in a small stewpan. Let it boil half an hour,
pass the liquor through a hair sieve, dissolve in it a pound and
a half of powdered loaf sugar, clear it over the fire, with the
white of an egg beaten to a froth, and a little rose or orange-flower
water, and let it simmer gently till the syrup is formed
and clear. When quite cold, put it in bottles, which must be
closely corked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1258. <em>Syrup of Ginger.</em>&mdash;Steep an ounce and a half of beaten
ginger in a quart of boiling water, closely covered up for twenty-four
hours; then, straining off the infusion, make it into a syrup,
by adding at least two pounds of fine loaf sugar, dissolved, and
boiled up in a hot water bath.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1259. <em>French Rossolis, perfumed with Flowers.</em>&mdash;Boil two
quarts of spring water, to take off the hardness; then take it
off the fire, and when it is only lukewarm, throw in a pinch of
the most odoriferous flowers, and let them infuse till the liquid
is cold, and the fragrance all extracted. Then take away the
flowers with a skimmer, strain the liquid, and add to it a pint
of clarified syrup, and half a pint of spirits of wine, and a rossolis,
or sun-dew, will be produced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1260. <em>Bergamot Water.</em>&mdash;Make a pint of syrup; and when
cold, press into it half a dozen fine lemons, with, or without, a
Seville orange, or two China oranges, adding as much water as
may be necessary; then putting in a tea-spoonful of genuine
essence of bergamot, run the whole through a lawn sieve, and
it is immediately ready for drinking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1261. <em>Peach and Apricot Waters.</em>&mdash;Both these waters, as well
as those of other fruits, are readily made by mixing two or
three table-spoonfuls of the respective jams with a few blanched
and pounded bitter almonds, lemon-juice, and cold spring water,
with powdered loaf sugar to your taste. On being run through
a lawn sieve, these waters are immediately fit to drink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1262. <em>Persian and Turkish Sherbet.</em>&mdash;The method pursued
by the Persians, Turks, &amp;c., is to extract the fragrant, rich, and
acidulated juices of the finest flowers and fruits, and make them,
with the addition of sugar, into what we call fruit jellies or
lozenges, which are dissolved in the purest spring water, and
thus form the agreeable beverage denominated sherbet. For
example, they evaporate the purified juice of citrons in a water
bath with a slow fire, till it becomes of nearly the consistence of
honey, melting, in the mean time, some finely powdered loaf
sugar in a silver dish, and continually stirring it with a flat
wooden spoon; when the sugar is very dry, they sprinkle over
it, a little at a time, the prepared juice of citron; continuing to
stir it till the whole has sufficient moisture to form a paste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
which they make into lozenges, and keep in a dry, and rather
warm situation; in this way, they prepare all the acid juices,
such as barberries, lemons, gooseberries, &amp;c.: with the less
acid and more delicately flavored fruits, they proceed differently,
only well heating the sugar in a silver dish, adding to it by degrees
the fresh juice, and stirring it constantly till a paste is
formed. This must not be made into lozenges till perfectly dry,
and they must be put into a box lined with paper, and kept in
a dry place. They are variously prepared with orange-flowers,
roses, &amp;c. The Persians and Turks are said to prepare a favorite
sherbet with violet vinegar, pomegranate-juice, and sugar
formed into lozenges.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1263. <em>Hypocras, as made at Paris.</em>&mdash;Put into a quart of the
best and strongest red wine half a pound of powdered loaf
sugar, half a dram of cinnamon, a pinch of coriander seeds, two
white pepper-corns, a little Seville orange peel, a blade of mace,
a small quantity of lemon-juice, and four cloves; the spices, &amp;c.,
being all previously beaten in a mortar. When the whole has
infused three or four hours, add a table-spoonful of milk; and
filtering the liquid through a flannel bag, it will prove excellent
for present or future use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1264. <em>Strawberry Sherbet.</em>&mdash;On half a pound of sugar of the
best quality, broken into lumps, pour a quart of spring water.
Let it stand until nearly dissolved; give it a stir, and boil it
for about ten minutes. Take off the scum, and throw into the
syrup a pint and a half of sound ripe strawberries, measured
without their stalks. Let these simmer gently until they shrink
much and begin to break, and keep them well skimmed, or the
sherbet will not be clear. Before it is taken from the fire, add the
strained juice of a sound fresh lemon, then turn the preparation
into a jelly-bag, or let it stand for a quarter of an hour, and
then strain it through a muslin folded in four. This latter
method is generally quite sufficient to render any liquid not
thickened by the <em>over</em>-boiled pulp of fruit, quite transparent.
When strawberries abound, a quart, or even more, may be
used for this preparation; and the proportion of sugar can always
be increased or diminished to the taste. To give the
sherbet an Oriental character, boil in it the petals of six or
eight orange, lemon, or citron blossoms; or orange-flower
water may be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1265. <em>Lemonade</em> (<em>Italian</em>).&mdash;Two dozen lemons must be pared
and pressed; the juice should be poured on the peels, and remain
on them all night; in the morning add two pounds of
loaf sugar, a quart of good white wine, and three quarts of
boiling water. When these ingredients are blended, add a
quart of boiling milk. Strain the whole through a jelly-bag
till it becomes quite clear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1266. <em>Lemonade.</em>&mdash;One of the best methods of making lemonade
is to prepare a syrup of sugar and water, over a clear fire,
skimming it quite clean; to this add the juice of any number
of lemons, according to the quantity you wish to make; also
some of the rinds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1267. <em>Rich Orangeade.</em>&mdash;Steep the yellow rinds of six China,
and two Seville oranges in a quart of boiling water, closely
covered up for five or six hours; then make a syrup with a
pound of sugar, and three pints of water, mix the infusion and
syrup together, press in the juice of a dozen China oranges, and
the two Seville oranges from which the rind was taken, stir the
whole well together, and run it through a jelly-bag; afterwards,
if agreeable, a little orange-flower water, with some capillaire
syrup, may be added, should sweetness be wanted. Two
lemons may be used, as well as the two Seville oranges;
but care should be taken that the flavor of the lemons does not
predominate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1268. <em>Orgeat Paste.</em>&mdash;This paste, which will keep twelve
months, is nearly as soon made into orgeat as the orgeat syrup.
The mode of preparing it in Paris, is by well pounding blanched
almonds with a little water, to prevent their turning to oil;
then adding half the weight of the almonds in pounded sugar,
and mixing both together into a paste.</p>

<p>Of this paste, when wanted, mix a small portion, about the
size of an egg, in a pint of spring water, and strain it through
a napkin. The usual English mode of making orgeat paste is,
by pounding in the same manner, half an ounce of bitter, to a
pound of sweet, almonds; and boiling a quart of common
syrup, till it becomes what is called blow; mixing the almonds
with it over the fire, well stirred all the time, to prevent burning,
till it becomes a stiff paste; then, on its getting quite cold,
putting it in pots, to be used in the same manner as the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1269. <em>To cork, and preserve Cider in Bottles.</em>&mdash;Good corks
are highly necessary, and if soaked before used in scalding
water, they will be more the pliant and serviceable; and by laying
the bottles so that the liquor may always keep the cork wet
and swelled, will much preserve it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1270. <em>Soda Water and Ginger Beer Powders.</em>&mdash;Carbonate of
soda and tartaric acid, of each two ounces; fine loaf sugar
rolled and sifted, six ounces; pure essence of lemon, twenty-five
or thirty drops. To be well mixed in a marble mortar,
kept in a bottle closely corked, and <em>in a very dry place</em>. When
required for use, two tea-spoonfuls to less than a half pint of
water, to be mixed in a glass that will hold twice that quantity,
and drunk while in a state of effervescence. If half an ounce
or one ounce (according as it may be liked more or less hot),
of best ground ginger be mixed with the above quantity, it will
be "ginger-beer powder."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1271. <em>Spruce Beer.</em>&mdash;For <em>white</em> spruce, pour ten gallons of
boiling water upon six pounds of good raw or lump sugar, and
four ounces of essence of spruce; ferment with half a pint of
good yeast, put into stone bottles, cork and tie them over.
For <em>brown</em> spruce use treacle instead of sugar.</p>

<p>Essence of spruce is a remedy for colds, rheumatisms, &amp;c.,
if drunk warm at bed-time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1272. <em>An Irish Cordial.</em>&mdash;To every pound of white currants
stripped from the stalks and bruised, put the very thin rind of
a large fresh lemon, and a quarter of an ounce of ginger, well
pounded and sifted. Pour on these one quart of good old whiskey;
mix the whole up thoroughly, and let it stand for twenty-four
hours in a new well-scalded stone pitcher, or deep pan
(<em>crock</em>), covered closely from the air. Strain it off; stir in it,
until dissolved, a pound and a quarter of pounded sugar, and
strain it again and bottle it. This is an Irish receipt, and is
given without variation from the original.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1273. <em>To prevent Beer from growing flat.</em>&mdash;In a cask containing
eighteen gallons of beer, becoming vapid, put a pint of
ground malt, suspended in a bag, and close the bung perfectly;
the beer will be improved during the whole time of drawing it
for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1274. <em>To recover sour Beer.</em>&mdash;When beer has become sour,
put into the barrel some oyster-shells, calcined to whiteness, or
a little fine chalk or whiting. Any of these will correct the
acidity, and make the beer brisk and sparkling; but it cannot
be kept long after these additions are made.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1275. <em>Rose Vinegar for Salads or the Toilette.</em>&mdash;To one quarter
of a pound of rose-leaves put two quarts of good vinegar;
cover it firmly; leave it to infuse till a fine tincture is obtained;
then strain it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1276. <em>Raspberry Vinegar.</em>&mdash;Pour one quart of vinegar on
two pounds of fresh raspberries, and let it stand twenty-four
hours. Then strain them through a hair-sieve without breaking
the fruit; put the liquor on two pounds more fruit, and,
after straining it in the same manner, add to each pint of juice
half a pound of loaf sugar; put it in a stone vessel, and let it
stand in boiling water until the sugar is dissolved; when cold,
take off the scum, and bottle it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1277. <em>Cheap and easy method of Brewing.</em>&mdash;One bushel of
malt and three-quarters of a pound of hops will, on an average,
brew twenty gallons of good beer.</p>

<p>For this quantity of malt, boil twenty-four gallons of water;
and, having dashed it in the copper with cold water to stop the
boiling, steep the malt (properly covered up) for three hours;
then tie up the hops in a hair-cloth, and boil malt, hops, and
wort, altogether, for three-quarters of an hour, which will reduce
it to about twenty gallons. Strain it off, and set it to
work when lukewarm.</p>

<p>In large brewings, this process perhaps would not answer,
but in small ones, where the waste is not so great, and where
the malt can be boiled, the essence is sure to be extracted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1278. <em>To make excellent and wholesome Table Beer.</em>&mdash;To eight
quarts of boiling water put a pound of treacle, a quarter of an
ounce of ginger, and two bay leaves; let this boil for a quarter
of an hour, then cool, and work it with yeast, the same as other
beer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1279. <em>How the Chinese make Tea.</em>&mdash;The art of making tea
consists in pouring the water on and off immediately, so as to
get the flavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1280. <em>Tea, economically.</em>&mdash;Young Hyson is supposed to be a
more profitable tea than Hyson; but though the <em>quantity</em> to a
pound is greater, it has not so much <em>strength</em>. In point of
economy, therefore, there is not much difference between them.
Hyson tea and Souchong mixed together, half and half, is a
pleasant beverage, and is more healthy than green tea alone.
Be sure that water boils before it is poured upon tea. A
tea-spoonful to each person, and one extra thrown in, is a good
rule. Steep a few minutes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1281. <em>Turkish method of making Coffee.</em>&mdash;The coffee must
be slowly roasted, not burnt, and brought only to an amber
brown: it must be roasted day by day. The flavor dissipates
in a few hours; it must be reduced by pounding to an impalpable
powder. In making it, two opposite and, apparently, incompatible
ends are to be secured&mdash;strength and flavor. To
obtain the first, it must be boiled; by boiling, the second is
lost. The difficulty is surmounted by a double process&mdash;one
thorough cooking, one slight one; by the first a strong infusion
is obtained; by the second, that infusion is flavored. Thus a
large pot with coffee-lees stands simmering by the fire; this is
the sherbet. When a cup is wanted, the pounded coffee is put
in the little tin or copper pan, and placed on the embers; it
fumes for a moment, then the sherbet is poured on; in a few
seconds the froth (caïmah) rises; presently an indication that
it is about to boil is made manifest, when the coffee is instantly
taken from the fire, carried into the apartment, turned into the
cup, and drank.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1282. <em>Cheap and valuable substitute for Coffee.</em>&mdash;The flour of
rye, and yellow potatoes, are found an excellent substitute for
coffee. Boil, peel, and mash the potatoes, and then mix with
the meal into a cake, which is to be dried in an oven, and afterwards
reduced to a powder, which will make a beverage
very similar to coffee in its taste, as well as in other properties,
and not in the least detrimental to health.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1283. <em>Substitute for Cream.</em>&mdash;If you have not cream for
coffee, it is a very great improvement to boil your milk, and
use it while hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1284. <em>Cocoa</em> is the foundation of chocolate; it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
pounded, and either boiled as milk, or boiling water may be
poured on it. It is very digestible, and of a fattening nature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1285. <em>Racahout des Arabes; a pleasant beverage for Invalids.</em>&mdash;Mix
thoroughly one pound of ground rice; one pound of arrow-root;
half pound of fine chocolate. Put the mixture into
a jar for use. When it is wanted, make a tablespoonful of the
Racahout into a paste with cold water or milk; then stir it
into half a pint of boiling milk, and let it boil up for a minute
or two; add sugar, if agreeable, and drink it as you would
chocolate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1286. <em>How to judge the Properties of Nutmegs.</em>&mdash;The largest,
heaviest, and most unctuous of nutmegs are to be chosen, such
as are the shape of an olive, and of the most fragrant smell.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1287. <em>To keep Grapes.</em>&mdash;Gather the grapes in the afternoon
of a dry day, before they are perfectly ripe. Have ready a
clean dry barrel and wheat bran. Proceed then with alternate
layers of bran and grapes, till the barrel is full, taking care that
the grapes do not touch each other, and to let the last layer be
of bran; then close the barrel, so that the air may not be able
to penetrate, which is an essential point. Grapes, thus packed,
will keep nine or even twelve months. To restore them to
their freshness, cut the end of the stalk of each bunch of grapes,
and put that of white grapes into white wine, and that of the
black grapes into red wine, as you would put flowers into water,
to revive or keep them fresh.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1288. <em>To keep Oranges and Lemons.</em>&mdash;Take small sand and
make it very dry; after it is cold, put a quantity of it into a
clean vessel; then take your oranges, and set a laying of them
in the same, the stalk-end downwards, so that they do not touch
each other, and strew in some of the sand, as much as will
cover them two inches deep; then set your vessel in a cold
place, and you will find your fruit in high preservation at the
end of several months.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1289. <em>Another Method.</em>&mdash;Freeze the oranges, and keep them
in an ice-house. When to be used, put them into a vessel of
cold water till they are thawed. By this means they may be
had in perfection at any season of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1290. <em>Keeping Apples.</em>&mdash;Apples should be placed on a dry
floor three weeks before they are packed away in barrels. They
should be kept in a cool place; if inclosed in a water-tight cask,
they may be kept all winter in a loft or garret without further
care, and will come out sound and fresh in the spring.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1291. <em>To keep Onions.</em>&mdash;Onions should be kept very dry, and
never carried into the cellar except in severe weather, when
there is danger of their freezing. By no means let them be in
the cellar after March; they will sprout and spoil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1292. <em>A good way of cooking onions.</em>&mdash;It is a good plan to
boil onions in milk and water; it diminishes the strong taste
of that vegetable. It is an excellent way of serving up onions,
to chop them after they are boiled, and put them in a stewpan,
with a little milk, butter, salt, and pepper, and let them stew
about fifteen minutes. This gives them a fine flavor, and they
can be served up very hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1293. <em>To keep Parsnips.</em>&mdash;Parsnips should be kept down cellar,
covered up in sand, entirely excluded from the air. They
are good only in the Spring.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1294. <em>To keep Cabbages.</em>&mdash;Cabbages put into a hole in the
ground will keep well during the winter, and be hard, fresh, and
sweet in the Spring. Many farmers keep potatoes in the same
way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1295. <em>To keep Potatoes.</em>&mdash;The cellar is the best place for them,
because they are injured by wilting; but sprout them carefully,
if you want to keep them. They never sprout but three times;
therefore, after you have sprouted them three times, they will
trouble you no more.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;Boiled potatoes are said to cleanse the hands as well
as common soap; they prevent <em>chaps</em> in the winter season, and
keep the skin soft and healthy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1290. <em>Boiling Potatoes.</em>&mdash;The following method of dressing
potatoes will be found of great use at the season of the year,
when skins are tough and potatoes are watery. Score the skin
of the potato with a knife, lengthwise and across, quite around,
and then boil the potato in plenty of water and salt, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
skin on. The skin readily cracks when it is scored, and lets
out the moisture, which otherwise renders the potato soapy and
wet. The improvement to bad potatoes by this method of
boiling them is very great, and all who have tried it find a
great advantage in it, now that good potatoes are very difficult
to be obtained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1297. <em>To keep Celery.</em>&mdash;Celery should be kept in the cellar,
the roots covered with tan, to keep them moist.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1298. <em>To keep Lettuce.</em>&mdash;If the tops of lettuce be cut off when
it is becoming too old for use, it will grow up again fresh and
tender, and may thus be kept good through the summer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1299. <em>Good Squashes.</em>&mdash;Green squashes that are turning yellow,
and striped squashes, are more uniformly sweet and mealy
than any other kind.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1300. <em>To dry Pumpkin.</em>&mdash;Cut it round horizontally in tolerably
thin slices, peel them and hang them on a line in a warm
room. When perfectly dry, put them away for use. When
you wish to use it, put it to soak over night; next day pour off
the water, put on fresh water, stew and use it as usual, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another and, as some think, a much better way, is to boil
and sift the pumpkin, then spread it out thin in tin plates, and
dry hard in a warm oven. It will keep good all the year
round, and a little piece boiled up in milk will make a batch
of pies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1301. <em>To pickle large Mushrooms.</em>&mdash;Pick them carefully, and
take out the stalks; put them into a jar, and pour on them
boiling spiced vinegar, with a little salt in it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1302. <em>To preserve Green Currants.</em>&mdash;Currants may be kept
fresh for a year or more, if they are gathered when green, separated
from the stems, put into dry, clean junk bottles, and
corked very carefully, so as to exclude the air. They should
be kept in a cool place in the cellar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1303. <em>Walnut Ketchup.</em>&mdash;Take half a bushel of green walnuts,
before the shell is formed, and grind them in a crab mill,
or beat them in a marble mortar; then squeeze out the juices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
through a coarse cloth, and wring the cloth well to get all the
juice out, and to every gallon of juice put a quart of red wine,
a quarter of a pound of anchovies, the same of bay salt, one
ounce of allspice, two of long or black pepper, half an ounce of
cloves and mace, a little ginger and horse-radish, cut in slices;
boil all together till reduced to half the quantity; pour into a
pan; when it is cold bottle it, cork it tight, and it will be fit to
use in three months. If you have any pickle left in the jar
after your walnuts are used, to every gallon of pickle put in two
heads of garlic, a quart of red wine, an ounce each of cloves
and mace, long, black, and Jamaica pepper, and boil them all
together, till it is reduced to half the quantity, pour it into a
pan, and the next day bottle it for use, and cork it tight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1304. <em>To discover if Bread is adulterated with Alum.</em>&mdash;Make
a solution of lime in aquafortis, and put a little of this solution
into water, in which you have steeped the bread suspected to
contain alum. If such should be the case, the acid, which was
combined with the alum, will form a precipitate or chalky concretion
at the bottom of the vessel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1305. <em>To preserve Biscuit from Putrefaction.</em>&mdash;To preserve
biscuit a long time sweet and good, no other art is necessary
than stowing it, well baked, in casks exactly caulked,
and carefully lined with tin, so as to exclude the air; at the
same time the biscuit must be so placed as to leave as little vacant
room as possible in the cask; and when the same is
opened through necessity, it must be speedily closed again with
great care.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1306. <em>A good Yeast.</em>&mdash;Put into one gallon of water a double-handful
of hops;&mdash;boil them fifteen or twenty minutes, then
strain off the water while it is scalding hot; stir in wheat flour
or meal till it becomes a thick batter, so that it will hardly
pour;&mdash;let it stand till it becomes about blood-warm, then add
a pint of good lively yeast, and stir it well; and then let it
stand in a place where it will be kept at a temperature of about
seventy degrees Fahrenheit, till it becomes perfectly light,
whether more or less time is required; and then it is fit for
use;&mdash;or if it is desired to keep a portion of it, let it stand several
hours and become cool; and then put it into a clean jug
and cork it tight, and place it in the cellar, where it will keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
cool; and it may be preserved good, ten or twelve days, and
even longer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1307. <em>The Dairy.</em>&mdash;Dairymen will find a great advantage in
cheese making, by putting their milk, which is to stand over
night, into small air-tight vessels. They will also find it an
advantage, when it thunders, to suspend the vessels by a cord
or chain, as the jarring of the shocks, which sour the milk, will,
in a great measure, be prevented. We may prevent the commencement
of sourness, which takes place in milk standing in
large quantities, by a wooden follower being fitted to the vat,
and pressed on the milk. If any one doubt the utility of this,
let him try the experiment for himself. Cover the bottom of
your cheese-vat to the depth of half an inch with milk, and let
it stand through the night, and then try to make a breakfast of
it in the morning. You could relish tallow as well, or a piece
of bread and butter that had lain in the sun an hour. Neither
milk, butter, nor cheese will do to stand in the light of the sun,
though it be reflected, as it will produce rancidity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1308. <em>Butter.</em>&mdash;Keep your pails, churn, and pans sweet. In
winter warm the pans and churns with hot water, in summer
cool them with cold. Keep your milk in summer where it is
cool and airy, in winter where it is warm. In warm weather
skim your milk as soon as it is thick; in colder weather skim as
soon as there is a good thick cream, and be careful not to let
it remain too long, as it will acquire a bad taste. Churn as
often as you have cream enough, never less than once a week.
If the cream is of the right temperature when commenced, it
will not froth, and if it does, put in a little salt. Use no salt
but the best ground salt; work out all the butter-milk with a
ladle in summer, in winter use clean hands. If you wish to
keep it some time, put it down in a jar or firkin, or pickle in
layers, as clean and free from butter-milk as it is possible, leaving
a space for pickle over it, in the following proportions.
Half a pail of water, one quart of fine salt, two ounces of loaf-sugar,
one ounce of saltpetre, well boiled and skimmed. When
cold, cover with this, and it will keep good and sweet, the year
round.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1309. <em>Cream.</em>&mdash;The quantity of cream on milk may be
greatly increased by the following process: Have two pans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
ready in boiling hot water, and when the new milk is brought
in, put it into one of these hot pans and cover it with the
other. The quality as well as the thickness of the cream is
improved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1310. <em>Method of curing bad Tub Butter.</em>&mdash;A quantity of tub
butter was brought to market in the West Indies, which, on
opening, was found to be very bad, and almost stinking. A
native of Pennsylvania undertook to cure it, which he did, in
the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>He started the tubs of butter in a large quantity of hot water,
which soon melted the butter; he then skimmed it off as
clean as possible, and worked it over again in a churn, and
with the addition of salt and fine sugar, the butter was sweet
and good.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1311. <em>Method of taking the Rankness and disagreeable Taste
from Irish Salt Butter.</em>&mdash;The quantity proposed to be made use
of, either for toasts or melting, must be put into a bowl filled
with boiling water, and when the butter is melted, skim it quite
off; by this method it is so separated from any gross particles,
that it may require a small addition of salt, which may be put
into the cold water that is made use of in melting butter for
sauce; and though the butter is oiled by hot water, it becomes
a fine cream in the boiling for sauce.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1312. <em>To remove the Taste of Turnips from Milk or Butter.</em>&mdash;The
taste of the turnip is easily taken off milk and butter, by
dissolving a little nitre in spring water, which being kept in a
bottle, and a small tea-cupful put into eight gallons of milk,
when warm from the cow, entirely removes any taste or flavor
of the turnip.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1313. <em>To make Salt Butter fresh.</em>&mdash;Put four pounds of salt
butter into a churn, with four quarts of new milk, and a small
portion of arnotto. Churn them together, and, in about an
hour, take out the butter, and treat it exactly as fresh butter,
by washing it in water, and adding the customary quantity of
salt.</p>

<p>This is a singular experiment. The butter gains about three
ounces in each pound, and is in every particular equal to fresh
butter. It would be greatly improved by the addition of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
or three ounces of fine sugar, in powder. A common earthen
churn answers the same purpose as a wooden one, and may be
purchased at any pot shop.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1314. <em>Method of making Stilton Cheese.</em>&mdash;Take the night's
cream, and put it to the morning's new milk, with the rennet;
when the curd is come it is not to be broken, as is done with
other cheeses, but take it out with a soil dish all together, and
place it on a sieve to drain gradually, and, as it drains, keep
gradually pressing it, till it becomes firm and dry; then place
it in a wooden hoop; afterwards to be kept dry on boards,
turned frequently, with cloth-binders round it, which are to be
tightened as occasion requires.</p>

<p>In some dairies the cheeses, after being taken out of the
wooden hoop, are bound tight round with a cloth, which cloth
is changed every day until the cheese becomes firm enough to
support itself; after the cloth is taken away, they are rubbed
every day all over, for two or three months, with a brush; and
if the weather is damp or moist, twice a day; and even before
the cloth is taken off, the top and bottom are well rubbed
every day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1315. <em>Coloring for Cheese.</em>&mdash;The coloring for cheese is, <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'or at at least'">or
at least</span> should be, Spanish arnotto; but as soon as coloring became
general in this country, a color of an adulterated kind was
exposed for sale in almost every shop; the weight of a guinea
and a half of real Spanish arnotto is sufficient for a cheese of
fifty pounds' weight. If a considerable part of the cream of the
night's milk be taken for butter, more coloring will be requisite.
The leaner the cheese is, the more coloring it requires.
The manner of using arnotto is to tie up, in a linen rag, the
quantity deemed sufficient, and put it into half a pint of warm
water over night. This infusion is put into the tub of milk, in
the morning, with the rennet infusion; dipping the rag into the
milk, and rubbing it against the palm of the hand as long as any
color runs out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1316. <em>To make Cement for Bottles or Preserve Jars.</em>&mdash;Take
one-third bees'-wax and two-thirds rosin, according to the quantity
of cement required. Pound the rosin fine, and put it with
the wax to melt in any old vessel fit for the purpose. When
it is melted, take it off the fire, and add powdered brick-dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
till it is as thick as melted sealing-wax. Then dip the bottle
necks into the cement, and in a few minutes the mixture will
be dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1317. <em>Blue Wash for Walls.</em>&mdash;Take one pound of lump blue
vitriol; pound it in a stone mortar as fine as possible; dissolve
it in a quart or two of hot water. Slake about a quarter of a
peck, or perhaps a little more of lime, and when <em>cold</em> pour in
the blue water by degrees, and make it whatever shade you
desire.</p>

<p>The lime must be slaked and the vitriol dissolved in earthen
or stone ware, and the whole mixture stirred with a metal
spoon. If wood is used for any of the above purposes, the
color will be changed. A new brush should also be used to
put it on the walls, and they must first have a coat or two of
whitewash, to destroy all smoke and other impurities.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1318. <em>Yellow Wash for Walls.</em>&mdash;One quarter of a pound of
chrome yellow, one quarter of a pound of gum senegal, two
pounds of whiting.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>EASY AND CHEAP MODE OF COLORING CLOTHING, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>1319. "<em>Blue Composition</em>," a compound of vitriol and indigo,
is usually kept by hatters and apothecaries. It colors a
good and durable blue. An ounce vial, that may be bought
for a trifle, will color a large number of articles. It is an economical
plan to use it for old silk linings, ribbons, &amp;c. The
original color should be boiled out, and the material thoroughly
rinsed in soft water, so that no soap may remain in it; for soap
ruins the dye. Twelve or sixteen drops of the blue composition,
poured into a quart bowl full of warm soft water, stirred,
(and strained, if any settlings are perceptible,) will color a great
many articles. If you wish a deep blue, pour in more of the
compound. Cotton must not be colored; the vitriol destroys
it; if the material you wish to color has cotton threads in it,
it will be ruined. After the things are thoroughly dried, they
should be washed in cool suds, and dried again; this prevents
any bad effects from the vitriol; if shut up from the air,
without being washed, there is danger of the texture being destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1320. <em>How to color Green.</em>&mdash;If you wish to color green, have
your cloth free as possible from the old color, clean and rinsed,
and, in the first place, color it a deep yellow. Fustic boiled in
soft water makes the strongest and brightest yellow dye; but
saffron, barberry bush, peach leaves, or onion skins, will answer
pretty well. Next take a bowl full of strong yellow dye, and
pour in a great spoonful or more of the blue composition. Stir
it up well with a clean stick, and dip the articles you have already
colored yellow into it, and they will take a lively grass-green.
This is a good plan for old bombazet curtains, dessert
cloths, old flannel for desk coverings, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1321. <em>Slate Color.</em>&mdash;Tea-grounds boiled in iron, and set with
copperas, make a very good slate color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1322. <em>Purple Slate Color.</em>&mdash;The purple paper, which comes
on loaf sugar, boiled in cider, or vinegar, with a small bit of
alum, makes a fine purple slate color. Done in iron.</p>

<p>White maple bark makes a good light-brown slate color.
This should be boiled in water, set with alum. The color is
reckoned better when boiled in brass, instead of iron.</p>

<p>The purple slate and the brown slate are suitable colors for
stockings; and it is an economical plan, after they have been
mended and cut down, so that they will no longer look decent,
to color old stockings, and make them up for children.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1323. <em>To make Nankin Color.</em>&mdash;A pailful of lye, with a piece
of copperas half as big as a hen's egg boiled in it, will color a
fine nankin color, which will never wash out. This is very useful
for the linings of bed-quilts, comforters, &amp;c. Old faded
gowns, colored in this way, may be made into good petticoats.
Cheap cotton cloth may be colored to advantage for petticoats,
and pelisses for little girls.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1324. <em>Nankin Color, another way.</em>&mdash;The common <em>birch-bark</em>
makes a very beautiful nankin dye. Cover the bark with water,
and boil it thoroughly in a brass or tin kettle. Bark stripped
from the trees in autumn is best. Set the color with alum. A
piece as large as a hen's egg is sufficient for two pailsful of dye.
Dip the articles, wet thoroughly in clean water, into the alum
water, then into the dye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1325. <em>To make Straw-color and Yellow.</em>&mdash;Saffron, steeped in
earthen and strained, colors a fine straw color. It makes a delicate
or deep shade, according to the strength of the tea. The
dry outside skins of onions, steeped in scalding water and
strained, color a yellow very much like the "bird of paradise"
color. Peach leaves, or bark scraped from the barberry bush,
color a common bright yellow. In all these cases, a little bit
of alum does no harm, and may help to fix the color. Ribbons,
gauze handkerchiefs, &amp;c., are colored well in this way, especially
if they be stiffened by a bit of gum-arabic, dropped in while the
stuff is steeping.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1326. <em>To make Rose-color.</em>&mdash;Balm blossoms, steeped in water,
color a pretty rose-color. This answers very well for the
linings of children's bonnets, for ribbons, &amp;c. It fades in the
course of one season, but it is very little trouble to re-color
with it. It merely requires to be steeped and strained. Perhaps
a small piece of alum might serve to set the color, in some
degree. In earthen or tin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1327. <em>To color Black.</em>&mdash;Logwood and cider, boiled together,
in iron&mdash;add water for the evaporation&mdash;makes a good and durable
black. Rusty nails, or any bits of rusty iron, boiled in
vinegar, with a small piece of copperas, will also dye black; so
will ink-powder, if boiled with vinegar. In all cases, black
must be set with copperas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1328. <em>General Rules for Coloring.</em>&mdash;The materials should be
perfectly clean; soap should be rinsed out in soft water; the
article should be entirely wetted, or it will spot; light colors
should be steeped in brass, tin, or earthen; and if set at all,
should be set with alum. Dark colors should be boiled in
iron, and set with copperas. Too much copperas rots the
thread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1329. <em>To Wash Carpets.</em>&mdash;Put the carpets down on a perfectly
clean floor; wash them first with warm and weak soap-suds,
wringing the wash-cloth almost dry; rinse them with
clear water. Open the windows, that they may dry quickly.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the above directions are only applicable to
the lighter sorts of carpets, Scotch, Kidderminster, and Venetian.
If it be desired to cleanse a carpet which has an under-texture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of thread, as Brussels, tapestry, or velvet, the carpet
having been well beaten or shaken, and washed, should be
spread out, and scrubbed with a scrubbing brush and ox-gall.
A pint of gall and three gallons of water will clean a
large carpet.</p>

<p>After the use of the gall, the carpet must be thoroughly
rinsed, and dried in the open air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1330. <em>To Wash Clothes, on a small scale.</em>&mdash;For a wash for
three persons put three-quarters of an ounce of soda in soap and
water over the fire. Wash the clothes first in soap and
water; rub soap on the soiled or greasy places, and throw them
in the mixture. Let them boil an hour; rinse them in clear,
cold water; rinse them again in water with a little bluing in it.
If the clothes are much soiled, put them to soak over night.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1331. <em>Washing of Woollen Articles; an excellent way.</em>&mdash;It is
a common complaint that woollen articles thicken, shrink, and
become discolored in washing. The complaint applies both to
the lighter articles of knitted wool, such as shawls, &amp;c., and to
thicker and heavier materials&mdash;table baizes, carpets, and men's
woollen garments. The difficulty in either case may be obviated
by strict attention to the method about to be explained.
To clear the way, it may be well first to point out some things
which <em>never</em> ought to be done, but which frequently, perhaps
generally, are done:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Woollen articles are never to be washed in hard water,
nor in water softened by soda, potash, or anything of that kind.
Soap even should never touch them.</p>

<p>2. They are never to be rubbed at all.</p>

<p>3. They are never to be put in lukewarm water for washing,
nor in cold water for rinsing.</p>

<p>4. They are never to remain lying still in the water a single
minute.</p>

<p>5. They are never to be wrung.</p>

<p>6. When taken out of the water, they must not be laid down
at all, before the process of drying is commenced, nor at any
time afterwards until they are perfectly dry.</p>

<p>These things are to be avoided:&mdash;Now what is to be done?</p>

<p>1. Let the things to be washed be first well brushed and
shaken, to get rid of the dust.</p>

<p>2. Before the woollen things are wetted at all, take care to
have everything that will be required, ready and within reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>3. If several things are to be done, let each be begun and
finished separately. This makes no difference in expense or
trouble. A smaller vessel and smaller quantity of lather will
suffice, and the stuff in which one article has been washed,
would do no good, but harm, to others; it is, in fact, good for
nothing.</p>

<p>4. Use only fresh rain water, or very clear river water; rain
is preferable.</p>

<p>5. With a piece of sponge or old flannel, rub up a very
strong lather of either soft soap or best yellow soap. For very
large, greasy things, the lather may be made of ox-gall, half a
pint to six quarts of water, whisked up with a handful of birch
twigs (like that old-fashioned thing, a rod). In either case, the
lather may be prepared with a small quantity of water, and the
remainder added, boiling hot, the moment before using it. The
whole should be as hot as the hand can bear it; the hotter the
better. If the articles are very dirty, two lathers will be required
in succession; and unless a second person is at hand, to
rub up the second while the first is being used, both had better
be prepared in separate vessels before the wools are wetted,
leaving only the boiling water to be added.</p>

<p>6. Take the article to be washed, and without leaving hold
of it, keep on dipping and raising, dipping and raising, for two
or three minutes. By that time the lather will be absorbed by
the wool, and the liquor will resemble slimy suds.</p>

<p>7. Squeeze the article as dry as may be, without wringing
it.</p>

<p>8. The second lather having been brought to the same heat
as the first, proceed in the same manner, dipping and raising.
N. B.&mdash;If the article was very little soiled, and after the first
washing appears quite clear and clean, the second washing may
be in hot water without soap. Whether lather or water only,
a blue-bag may be slightly drawn through before the second
washing. When gall has been used, a third washing in hot
water only, will be required to take off the smell.</p>

<p>9. Having again squeezed the article as dry as may be, for
the lighter things, such as shawls, &amp;c., spread it on a coarse dry
cloth, pulling it out to its proper shape; lay over it another
coarse dry cloth, roll the whole up tightly, and let it remain
half an hour. This rule does not apply to large, heavy things;
they must be hung out at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1332. <em>To make Soft Soap.</em>&mdash;Bore some holes in your lye-barrel;
put some straw in the bottom; lay some unslaked lime
on it, and fill your barrel with good hard-wood ashes; wet it,
and pound it down as you put it in. When full, make a basin
in the ashes and pour in water; keep filling it as it sinks in the
ashes. In the course of a few hours the lye will begin to run.
When you have a sufficient quantity to begin with, put your
grease in a large iron pot, let it heat, pour in the lye, let it
boil, &amp;c. Three pounds of clean grease are allowed for two
gallons of soap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1333.&mdash;<em>Of Fish as Food.</em>&mdash;As food, fish is easier of digestion
than meats are, with the exception of salmon; this kind
of fish is extremely hearty food, and should be given sparingly
to children, and used cautiously by those who have weak
stomachs, or who take little exercise.</p>

<p>The small trout, found in rivers, are the most delicate and
suitable for invalids; lake fish are also excellent, and any kind
of fresh-water fish, if cooked immediately after being caught,
are always healthful.</p>

<p>But the ocean is the chief dependence for the fish-market,
and there is little danger (if we except salmon and lobsters)
that its kind of aliment will, in our country, be eaten to excess.
It would be better for the health of those who do not labor, if
they would use more fish and less flesh for food. But then fish
cannot be rendered so palatable, because it does not admit the
variety of cooking and flavors that other animal food does.</p>

<p>Fish is much less nutritious than flesh. The white kinds of
fish, cod, haddock, flounders, white fish, &amp;c., are the least nutritious;
the oily kinds, salmon, eels, herrings, &amp;c., are more
difficult to digest.</p>

<p>Shell fish have long held a high rank as restorative food; but
a well-dressed chop or steak is much better to recruit the
strength and spirits.</p>

<p><em>Cod</em>, <em>whiting</em>, and <em>haddock</em>, are better for being a little salted,
and kept one day before cooking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1334.&mdash;<em>Of Beef as Food.</em>&mdash;Ox beef is considered the best;
heifer beef is excellent where well fed, and is most suitable for
small families. If you want the best, choose that which has a
fine smooth grain&mdash;the lean of a bright red; the fat white or
nearly so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>The best roasting-piece is the sirloin; then the first three
ribs&mdash;if kept till they are quite tender, and boned, they are
nearly equal to the sirloin, and better for a family dinner.</p>

<p>The round is used for <em>alamode</em> beef, and is the best piece for
corning.</p>

<p>The best beef steak is cut from the inner part of the sirloin.
Good steak may be cut from the ribs.</p>

<p>If you wish to practise economy, buy the chuck, or piece
between the shoulder and the neck; it makes a good roast or
steak, and is excellent for stewing or baking. The thick part
of the flank is also a profitable piece; good to bake or boil, or
even roast.</p>

<p>The leg and shin of beef make the best soup&mdash;the heart is
profitable meat, and good broiled or roasted. The leg rand is
used for mince pies&mdash;it needs to be boiled till it is very tender.
The tongue, when fresh, is a rich part for mince pies. If eaten
by itself, it should be pickled and smoked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1335.&mdash;<em>Of Pork as Food.</em>&mdash;Pork, that is fed from the dairy,
and fattened on corn, is the best&mdash;potatoes do very well for
part of the feeding. But pork fattened from the still-house is
all but poisonous; it should never be eaten by those who wish
to preserve their health.</p>

<p>The offals, &amp;c., with which pork in the vicinity of a city is
fattened, make it unsavory and unwholesome. Such stuff
should be used for manure, and never given as food to animals,
whose flesh is to be eaten by man.</p>

<p>When pork is good, the flesh looks very white and smooth,
and the fat white and fine. Hogs two years old make the best&mdash;older
than that, their flesh is apt to be rank. Measly pork
is very unwholesome, and never should be eaten. It may be
known, as the fat is filled with small kernels.</p>

<p>When the rind is thick and tough, and cannot easily be impressed
with the finger, the pork is old, and will require more
cooking.</p>

<p>If pork is not cooked enough, it is disagreeable and almost
indigestible; it should never be eaten unless it is thoroughly
done.</p>

<p>The fat parts of pork are not very healthy food. Those who
labor hard may feel no inconvenience from this diet; but children
should never eat it; nor is it healthy for the delicate and
sedentary. Fat pork seems more proper as material for frying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
fish and other meats, and as a garnish, than to be cooked and
eaten by itself. It is best and least apt to prove injurious during
the cold weather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1336. <em>Of Mutton.</em>&mdash;Mutton is best from August till January.
It is nutritious, and often agrees better than any other meat
with weak stomachs. To have it tender, it must be kept as
long as possible without injury. Be sure and cook it till it is
<em>done</em>; the gravy that runs when the meat is cut, should <em>never
show the least tinge of blood</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1337. <em>Of using Gravies.</em>&mdash;Make it a general rule never to
pour gravy over any thing that is roasted; by so doing, the
dredging, &amp;c., is washed off and it eats insipid.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>SOME HINTS ON DIET, EXERCISE, AND ECONOMY.</h4>

<p>1338. <em>Meat for Children.</em>&mdash;Lamb, veal, and fowls are delicate
and healthy diet for the young and sedentary; and for all
who find fat meats and those of coarse fibre do not agree with
them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1339. <em>Economicals of Cooking Meats.</em>&mdash;The most economical
way of cooking meat is to <em>boil</em> it, if the liquid be used for soup
or broth, as it always ought to be.</p>

<p>Baking is one of the cheapest ways of dressing a dinner in
small families, and several kinds of meat are excellent, done in
this way. Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, and fillets
of veal will bake to much advantage; especially if they be fat.
Never bake a lean, thin piece; it will all shrivel away. Such
pieces should always be boiled or made into soup. Pigs, geese,
and the buttock of beef are all excellent baked. Meat always
loses in weight by being cooked.&mdash;In roasting, the loss is the
greatest. It also costs more in fuel to roast than to boil&mdash;still
there are many pieces of meat which seem made for roasting;
and it would be almost wrong to cook them in any other way.
Those who cannot afford to roast their meat, should not purchase
the sirloin of beef. Stewing meat is an excellent and
economical mode of cookery.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1340. <em>Butter as Diet.</em>&mdash;Butter, when new and sweet, is nutritious,
and, in our climate, generally healthy; during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
winter, when made very salt, it is not a good article of diet for
some people.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1341. <em>Condiments.</em>&mdash;Pepper, ginger, and most of the condiments,
are best during summer; they are productions of hot
climates, which shows them to be most appropriate for the hot
season. On the other hand, fat beef, bacon, and those kinds of
food we denominate "hearty," should be most freely used
during cold weather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1342. <em>Eat Slowly.</em>&mdash;Eat slowly. One of the most usual
causes of dyspepsia among our business men, arises from the
haste in which they swallow their food without sufficiently
chewing it, and then hurry away to their active pursuits. In
England very little business is transacted after dinner. There
ought to be, at least, one hour of quiet after a full meal, from
those pursuits which tax the brain, as well as those which exercise
the muscles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1343. <em>Of Breakfast.</em>&mdash;Persons of a delicate constitution
should never exercise much before breakfast.</p>

<p>If exposure of any kind is to be incurred in the morning,
breakfast should always be taken previously. The system is
more susceptible of infection and of the influence of cold,
miasma, &amp;c., in the morning before eating, than at any other
time.</p>

<p>Those who walk early will find great benefit from taking a
cracker or some little nourishment before going out.</p>

<p>Never go into a room of a morning, where a person is sick
with a fever, before you have taken nourishment of some kind&mdash;a
cup of coffee, at least.</p>

<p>In setting out early to travel, a light breakfast before starting
should always be taken; it is a great protection against
cold, fatigue and exhaustion.</p>

<p>In boarding schools for the young and growing, early breakfast
is an indispensable condition to health. Children should
not be kept without food in the morning till they are faint and
weary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1344. <em>Of Supper.</em>&mdash;Never eat a hearty supper just before
retiring to rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>Food should never be eaten when it is hot&mdash;bread is very
unhealthy, eaten in this way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1345. <em>Of Dinner.</em>&mdash;It is injurious to eat when greatly heated
or fatigued. It would very much conduce to the health of laboring
men, if they could rest fifteen or twenty minutes before
dinner.</p>

<p>The diet should always be more spare, with a larger proportion
of vegetables and ripe fruits, during summer. Fruits are
most wholesome in their appropriate season. The skins, stones,
and seeds, are indigestible.</p>

<p>Rich soups are injurious to the dyspeptic. Much liquid food
is rarely beneficial for adults; but a small quantity of plain,
nourishing soup is an economical and healthy beginning of a
family dinner.</p>

<p>Meats should always be sufficiently cooked. It is a savage
custom to eat meat in a half-raw-half-roasted state, and only a
very strong stomach can digest it.</p>

<p>Rich gravies should be avoided, especially in the summer
season.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1346.&mdash;<em>Of Drinks.</em>&mdash;Most people drink too much, because
they drink too fast. A wine-glass of water, sipped slowly, will
quench the thirst as effectually as a pint swallowed at a draught.
When too much is taken at meals, especially at dinner, it hinders
digestion. Better drink little during the meal, and then,
if thirsty an hour or two afterwards, more. The practice of
taking a cup of tea or coffee soon after dinner is a good one, if
the beverage be not drank too strong or too hot.</p>

<p>Dyspeptic people should be careful to take but a small quantity
of drink. Children require more, in proportion to their
food, than adults. But it is very injurious to them to allow a
habit of continual drinking as you find in some children. It
greatly weakens the stomach, and renders them irritable and
peevish.</p>

<p>The morning meal requires to be lighter and of a more fluid
nature than any other. Children should always, if possible to
be obtained, take milk&mdash;as a substitute, during the winter, good
gruel with bread, or water, sweetened with molasses, is healthy.
Never give children tea, coffee, or chocolate with their meals.</p>

<p>Coffee affords very little nourishment, and is apt, if drank
strong, to occasion tremors of the nerves. It is very bad for
bilious constitutions. The calm, phlegmatic temperament can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
bear it. With a good supply of cream and sugar, drank in
moderation, by those who exercise much and take considerable
solid food, it may be used without much danger.</p>

<p>Strong green tea relaxes the tone of the stomach, and excites
the nervous system. Persons of delicate constitution are almost
sure to be injured by it. Black tea is much less deleterious.
If used with milk and sugar, it may be considered
healthy for most people.</p>

<p>Chocolate, when it agrees with the constitution, is very nutritious
and healthy. But it seldom can be used steadily except
by aged persons who are very active. It agrees best with persons
of phlegmatic temperament; and is more healthy in the
winter season than during warm weather.</p>

<p>No kind of beverage should be taken hot&mdash;it injures the
teeth and impairs digestion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1347. <em>A few Rules for Health.</em>&mdash;Rise early. Eat simple
food. Take plenty of exercise. Never fear a little fatigue.
Let not children be dressed in tight clothes; it is necessary
their limbs and muscles should have full play, if you wish for
either health or beauty. Wash very often, and rub the skin
thoroughly with a coarse towel.</p>

<p>Wash the eyes in cold water every morning. Do not read
or sew at twilight, or by too dazzling a light. If far-sighted,
read with rather less light, and with the book somewhat nearer
to the eye, than you desire. If near-sighted, read with a book
as far off as possible. Both these imperfections may be diminished
in this way.</p>

<p>Clean teeth in pure water two or three times a day; but,
above all, be sure to have them clean before you go to bed.</p>

<p>Have your bed-chamber well aired; and have fresh bed linen
every week. Never have the wind blowing directly upon
you from open windows during the night. It is <em>not</em> healthy to
sleep in heated rooms.</p>

<p>Wear shoes that are large enough. It not only produces
corns, but makes the feet misshapen to cramp them.</p>

<p>Avoid the necessity of a physician, if you can, by careful attention
to your diet. Eat what best agrees with your system,
and resolutely abstain from what hurts you, however well you
may like it. A few days' abstinence, and cold water for a
beverage, with cold or warm bathing, as the case may require,
have driven off many an approaching disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>If you find yourself really ill, send for a good physician.
Have nothing to do with quacks; and do not tamper with
quack medicines. You do not know what they are; and what
security have you that they know what they are?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1348. <em>A few Remedies for Sickness.</em>&mdash;The <em>ague</em> may be rendered
milder by the timely use of an emetic, given one hour
before the fit is expected to return. For this purpose, one
scruple of ipecacuanha may be given in an ounce of water.
After each return of vomiting, give half a pint of tepid chamomile
tea, which may be repeated three or four times, but not
oftener. When the disease has continued for some days, and
the force of the fever is weakened by emetics, give to an adult
the following preparation of bark:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of Peruvian bark, in fine-powder, one ounce; port wine,
one quart; mix them, and let them stand together for twelve
hours. Shake the bottle, and give four large spoonsful immediately
after the hot stage of the disorder, repeating it every
second hour till the whole be taken; unless the coming on of
the next ague-fit should require its suspension.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1349. <em>Hysteric Affections.</em>&mdash;So numerous and various are the
symptoms said to belong to this disease, that it becomes difficult
to mark its peculiar character. It is frequently described
by the patient, as a round body moving in the bowels, ascending
to the stomach, and from thence affecting the throat with a
sense of stricture, threatening suffocation. The patient also
complains of palpitation, a costive habit, cold feet and legs, &amp;c.
To counteract the force of these attacks, the bowels should be
kept open by the following aperient mixture:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of infusion of senna, one ounce and a half; tincture of
senna, tincture of cardamoms, of each half an ounce. Three
large spoonsful to be taken occasionally.</p>

<p>The feet and legs should be kept warm, the head cool; the
diet should consist chiefly of animal food of easy digestion, as
beef or mutton; avoiding vegetables and malt liquor, indeed
everything that has a tendency to generate flatulency. As a
beverage, weak brandy and water, toast and water, tea or coffee,
whichever suits the palate of the patient, may be freely
used. Much depends on the cause&mdash;as that varies, so must the
treatment. <em>A dash of cold water on the face will frequently put
an end to the paroxysm.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1350. <em>Mumps</em> are sometimes epidemic and manifestly contagious;
they come on with shivering and a sense of coldness,
followed by an increased heat, and a considerable enlargement
of the glands on each side the neck, below the ear, near to the
angle of the jaw bone. This swelling continues to increase
until the fourth or fifth day, when it gradually subsides; but
before it entirely disappears, it often happens that other tumors
take place in the breasts of women, to which the male sex are
also subject in different parts of the body.</p>

<p>They are more or less painful, but commonly run their
course without any alarming symptoms, and therefore scarcely
require any remedies. This entirely depends on good nursing;
care should be taken to avoid exposure to cold air, and no application
should be used except a slight additional covering.
Fomentations, liniments, blisters, and whatever may have a
tendency to check the regular process of this disease, may
occasion a sudden determination to the brain, and prove fatal
to the patient.</p>

<p>A spare diet, gentle laxative medicines, and a free use of
weak diluting liquors, are the best means to be employed;
these, with a well-regulated temperature, will generally guard
off the secondary tumors. But when the disease has been improperly
managed, and a determination to any vital part
brought on, send for the physician.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1351. <em>Measles</em> frequently assume an alarming character, too
much so to entitle them to a place in the list of common casualties.
They are at all times too serious to be left, with safety,
in the hands of the domestic practitioner. Medical aid, therefore,
should be instantly sought for, as much depends on proper
management during the first stage of the fever. The approach
of this disease may be known, by attending to the symptoms
which precede the eruption, in the following order: First, the
patient complains of shivering, with a sense of coldness, a thin
watery discharge from the nose, hoarseness, cough, and a continued
flow of tears from the eyes, which appear red and
inflamed. These symptoms continue to increase in violence,
until the eruption is completed, when they gradually subside.
As this disorder has frequently a putrid tendency, which can
only be counteracted by the scientific skill of the physician, and
which, if neglected, or improperly treated, proves fatal, there
can be no excuse for not calling for his aid at the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
of the attack. But that no time may be lost, should
there be no physician present, an emetic of some gentle kind
may be given and repeated every half hour till vomiting be
excited. If it should not act on the bowels, take mild aperient
medicine every fourth hour; but this is not to be repeated after
a motion has been procured. The patient should be kept in an
equal temperature, near sixty-four degrees of Fahrenheit; if
exposed to a higher degree of heat, the fever might be increased;
if to a lower temperature, the cough and hoarseness would be
aggravated. Wine, or wine and water, and all other fermented
liquors must be avoided. Toast and water, barley water, apple-water,
rennet whey, tamarind tea, coffee, tea, or any other
weak diluting beverage, may be freely used, provided they are
of an equal warmth to milk when drawn from the cow; also,
weak lemonade.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1352. <em>Soothing Beverage for a Cough, after Measles.</em>&mdash;Two
ounces of figs, two ounces of raisins, two ounces of pearl barley,
and half an ounce of liquorice-root. Boil them together in a
pint and a half of water, and strain off the liquor. A tea-cupful
to be taken night and morning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1353. <em>Costiveness</em> may be relieved by a change of diet, exercise
on horseback, or any other exercise in the open air, or by
taking one of the following pills an hour before dinner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of Socotrine aloes, thirty grains; gum mastic, ten
grains; oil of wormwood, one drop; tincture of aloes, a sufficient
quantity to form the ingredients into a mass, which must be
divided into twelve pills.</p>

<p><em>This is an excellent dyspeptic pill, and will afford great relief
in all cases of weak digestion.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1354. <em>Remedies for Dysentery.</em>&mdash;Black or green tea, steeped
in boiling milk, seasoned with nutmeg, and best of loaf-sugar,
is excellent for the dysentery. Cork burnt to charcoal, about
as big as a hazel-nut, macerated, and put in a tea-spoonful of
brandy, with a little loaf sugar and nutmeg, is very efficacious
in cases of dysentery and cholera-morbus. If nutmeg be wanting,
peppermint-water may be used. Flannel wet with brandy,
powdered with Cayenne pepper, and laid upon the bowels,
affords great relief in cases of extreme distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1355. <em>Another Remedy.</em>&mdash;Dissolve as much table-salt in keen
vinegar as will ferment and work clear. When the foam is
discharged, cork it up in a bottle, and put it away for use. A
large spoonful of this, in a gill of boiling water, is very efficacious
in cases of dysentery and colic.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1356. <em>Loss of Appetite.</em>&mdash;This is generally symptomatic, and
varies according to the occasional cause. The continued use
of warm tea, of wine, or other spirituous liquors, diluted with
warm water, or the use of warm water alone, if long continued,
will occasion a relaxed state of the muscular coat of the stomach.
This organ also suffers from anxiety of mind, a sedentary
life, or a costive habit; from these and other causes it
becomes weakened, irritable, and incapable of digesting the
most simple food. To restore the tone of the stomach, first
give this emetic:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of ipecacuanha, in fine powder, one scruple; horse-radish
tea, two ounces. Mix them together. Between the times of
the operation, half a pint of horse-radish tea should be drank,
but not repeated oftener than twice or thrice. Afterwards
keep the bowels regular by the following aperient pills:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take, rhubarb, in fine powder, carbonated kali, of each thirty
grains; ginger, in fine powder, one scruple; balsam of Peru, a
sufficient quantity to form a mass; divide it into twenty-four
pills. Dose, three or four every other night, at bed-time.</p>

<p>At the same time, to restore the tone of the digestive organs,
the following decoction should be taken:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of Peruvian bark, six drachms; Cascarilla bark, two
drachms. Bruise them in a mortar, and boil them in a pint
and a half of water for a few minutes; strain off the liquor
while hot, then add tincture of bark, two ounces; diluted nitric
acid, a drachm and a half. Dose, four large spoonsful, three
times a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1357. <em>Cramp and Spasm.</em>&mdash;It frequently happens that persons
are extremely annoyed by cramp during the night, which
may be relieved by the following tincture:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take of tincture of opium, two drachms; ether, half an
ounce. Mix them together, and take thirty or forty drops every
night, at bed-time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1358. <em>How to apply Blisters.</em>&mdash;A considerable degree of pain
and inflammation often follows the application of blisters, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
may be obviated, by covering the blister-plaster with very thin
muslin, which will prevent any part of it remaining on the skin,
after the removal of the blister. The muslin should be pressed
down, and rubbed with the finger upon the surface of the blister-plaster.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1359. <em>Mustard Plasters</em>&mdash;Should be covered with muslin,
or the poultice put in a cloth bag, before being applied to the
skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1360. <em>To prevent Lock-jaw.</em>&mdash;Immerse the part injured in
strong lye, as warm as can be borne. But first, as in all cases
of wounds, apply spirits of turpentine on lint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1361. <em>For a Stiff Joint.</em>&mdash;An ointment made from the common
ground-worms, which boys dig to bait fishes, rubbed on
with the hand, is said to be excellent, when the sinews are
drawn up by disease or from a sprain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1362. <em>Easy Method of curing the Scurvy.</em>&mdash;The root of the
garden carrot abounds in a nutritious saccharine juice, and is
slightly aromatic. These are desirable properties against the
scurvy. To experience the good effects of these properties, <em>the
roots must be eaten raw</em>. There is nothing unpleasant in this;
on the contrary, it is what the common people often do by choice.
These roots would keep well during the longest voyage,
packed up in casks, having the interstices filled with
sand. Each sailor might be allowed to eat one root every day,
or every other day, according to the state of their health, and
the quantity of roots on board.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1363. <em>To make Cliver, or Goose-grass Ointment; remarkable
for its salutary effects in cases of inveterate Scurvy.</em>&mdash;To a pound
of hog's-lard melted, without spice or salt, put as much clivers
as the lard will moisten, and boil them together over a slow
fire; after stirring it till it becomes a little brown, strain it
through a cloth; and when cold, take the ointment from the
water that will remain at the bottom, and it will be fit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1364. <em>Easy Method of attracting Ear-wigs from the Ear.</em>&mdash;A
person lately having an earwig crept into his ear, and knowing
the peculiar fondness that insect has to apples, immediately applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
a piece of apple to the ear, which enticed the creature out,
and thereby prevented the alarming consequences which might
have otherwise ensued.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1365. <em>Simple remedies for Scarlet Fever.</em>&mdash;"Open the bowels
regularly every day, with some mild aperient medicine, such as
castor oil, senna, etc., and keep the patient at rest, and comfortably
warm; sponge the surface with tepid water, two or three
times a day; while it is hotter than natural, admit fresh air;
live on a bland diet, such as a cup full of arrow-root, several
times a day; toast-water for common drink. Gargle made of
strong sage tea, honey and alum, or borax, may be used from
the commencement, if the throat is affected."&mdash;<em>Dr. T. P.
Hereford.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1366. <em>The French Method of making Whey.</em>&mdash;Mix together
equal parts of best vinegar and cold water; a table-spoonful of
each will suffice for a pint of milk. It is not, however, all to
be put in, whether necessary or not; but when the milk just
boils, pour in just as much of the acid as will turn it, and no
more. Beat up together the white and shell of one egg, which
boil up in the whey. Then set it aside till quite clear. Pour
it off very steadily through a muslin strainer. Sweeten to
taste with loaf-sugar. This whey is very pleasant, and answers
every good purpose of white wine whey, while it is not liable
to the objection of being heating, and is also very much less
expensive.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1367. <em>Calves'-feet Jelly.</em>&mdash;Take two calves' feet, and add to
them one gallon of water; which reduce, by boiling, to one
quart. Strain it, and when cold skim the fat entirely off. Add
to this the white of six or eight eggs, well beaten, half a pint
of wine, half a pound of loaf-sugar, and the juice of four lemons,
and let them be well mixed. Boil the whole for a few minutes,
stirring it constantly, and then pass it through a flannel
strainer.</p>

<p>This forms a very nutritious article of diet for the sick and
convalescent. When it is desired, the wine can be omitted.&mdash;<em>Ellis.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1368. <em>Chicken Water.</em>&mdash;Take half a chicken, divested of all
fat, and break the bones; add to this half a gallon of water,
and boil for fifteen or twenty minutes. Season with salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>This was freely employed by the late Dr. Parrish in cholera
at its commencement. Taken warm, it produces vomiting, and
washes out the stomach.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1369. <em>Essence of Beef.</em>&mdash;Put into a porter bottle a sufficient
quantity of lean beef, sliced, to fill up its body, cork it with a
paper stopple, and place it in a pot of cold water, attaching the
neck, by means of a string, to the handle of the vessel. Boil
this for three-quarters of an hour, then pour off the liquor, and
skim it. To this preparation may be added spices and salt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1370. <em>A very reviving Odor.</em>&mdash;Fill with recently gathered,
and dried lavender-flowers, stripped from their stalks, small
wide-necked scent-bottles, and just cover them with <em>strong</em>
acetic acid. A morsel of camphor, the size of a hazel-nut, may
be added, with advantage, to the lavender, in each bottle.
Sound, new, and closely fitting corks should be used, to secure
the mixture from the air. It is exceedingly refreshing and
wholesome, and has often proved very acceptable to invalids.
The lavender should be gathered for it before it is quite fully
blown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1371. <em>Easy Method of obtaining Water in almost any situation.</em>&mdash;The
ground must be perforated by a borer. In the perforation
is placed a wooden pipe, which is driven down with a
mallet, after which the boring is continued, that the pipe may
be driven still farther. In proportion as the cavity of the
borer becomes loaded, it is drawn up and emptied; and in
time, by the addition of new portions of wooden pipe, the
boring is carried to any depth, and water is generally obtained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1372. <em>Method of Draining Ponds in Level Grounds.</em>&mdash;At a
certain distance below the surface of the earth, there sometimes
is a stratum of loose sand, which freely admits the passage of
water. This stratum is at various depths, in different elevations;
but it will be generally found, that lands most subject
to stagnant ponds have but a shallow stratum of clay over the
sand. All that is necessary, therefore, is to dig a pit in the
bottom of the pond, till you arrive at this stratum of sand,
when the water will be immediately absorbed, and the pond
emptied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1373. <em>To preserve Fishing-rods.</em>&mdash;Oil your rods, in summer,
with linseed oil, drying them in the sun, and taking care the
parts lie flat: they should be often turned, to prevent them
from warping. This will render them tough, and prevent their
being worm-eaten; in time they will acquire a beautiful brown
color. Should they get wet, which swells the wood, and makes
it fast in the sockets, turn the part round over the flame of a
candle a short time, and it will be easily set at liberty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1374. <em>To gild Letters on Vellum or Paper.</em>&mdash;Letters written
on vellum or paper are gilded in three ways; in the first, a little
size is mixed with the ink, and the letters are written as
usual; when they are dry, a slight degree of stickiness is produced
by breathing on them, upon which the gold leaf is immediately
applied, and by a little pressure may be made to adhere
with sufficient firmness. In the second method, some white-lead
or chalk is ground up with strong size, and the letters are
made with this by means of a brush; when the mixture is
almost dry, the gold leaf may be laid on, and afterwards burnished.
The last method is to mix up some gold powder with
size, and make the letters of this by means of a brush.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1375. <em>To make Pounce.</em>&mdash;Gum-sandarac, powdered and sifted
very fine, will produce an excellent preventive to keep ink from
sinking in the paper after you have had occasion to scratch out
any part of the writing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1376. <em>Another Method.</em>&mdash;Cuttle-fish bone, properly dried, one
ounce; best rosin, one ounce; and the same quantity of burnt
alum, well incorporated together, will make very good pounce
equal, if not superior, to any bought at the shops.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1377. <em>To cut Glass.</em>&mdash;Take a red-hot shank of a tobacco-pipe,
lay it on the edge of your glass, which will then begin to crack;
then draw the shank end a little gently before, and it will follow
any way you draw your hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1378. <em>Mrs. Hooker's Method of preparing and applying a
Composition for Painting in Imitation of the Ancient Grecian
Manner.</em>&mdash;Put into a glazed earthen vessel four ounces and a
half of gum arabic, and eight ounces, or half a pint (wine measure)
of cold spring water; when the gum is dissolved, stir in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
seven ounces of gum-mastic, which has been washed, dried,
picked, and beaten fine. Set the earthen vessel containing the
gum-water and gum-mastic over a slow fire, continually stirring
and beating them hard with a spoon, in order to dissolve the
gum-mastic; when sufficiently boiled, it will no longer appear
transparent, but will become opaque and stiff, like a paste. As
soon as this is the case, and the gum-water and mastic are quite
boiling, without taking them off the fire, add five ounces of
white wax, broken into small pieces, stirring and heating the
different ingredients together, till the wax is perfectly melted,
and has boiled. Then take the composition off the fire, as boiling
it longer than necessary would only harden the wax, and
prevent its mixing so well afterwards with water. When the
composition is taken off the fire, and in the glazed earthen vessel,
it should be beaten hard, and whilst hot (but not boiling)
mix with it, by degrees, a pint (wine measure) or sixteen
ounces more of cold spring water; then strain the composition,
as some dirt will boil out of the gum-mastic, and put it into
bottles. The composition, if properly made, should be like a
cream, and the colors when mixed with it as smooth as with oil.
The method of using it, is to mix with the composition, upon an
earthen pallet, such colors in powder, as are used in painting
with oil, and such a quantity of the composition to be mixed
with the colors as to render them of the usual consistency of
oil colors; then paint with fair water. The colors, when mixed
with the composition, may be laid on either thick or thin, as
may best suit your subject; on which account, this composition
is very advantageous, where any particular transparency of
coloring is required; but in most cases it answers best if the
colors be laid on thick, and they require the same use of the
brush as if painting with body colors, and the same brushes as
used in oil painting. The colors, if ground dry, when mixed
with the composition, may be used by putting a little fair water
over them; but it is less trouble to put some water when the
colors are observed to be growing dry. In painting with this
composition, the colors blend without difficulty when wet, and
even when dry the tints may easily be united by means of a
brush and a very small quantity of fair water. When the
painting is finished, put some white wax into a glazed earthen
vessel over a slow fire, and when melted, but not boiling, with
a hard brush cover the painting with the wax, and when cold
take a moderately hot iron, such as is used for ironing linen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and so cold as not to hiss, if touched with anything wet, and
draw it lightly over the wax. The painting will appear as if
under a cloud till the wax is perfectly cold, as also whatever
the picture is painted upon is quite cold; but if, when so, the
painting should not appear sufficiently clear, it may be held
before the fire, so far from it as to melt the wax but slowly;
or the wax may be melted by holding a hot poker at such a
distance as to melt it gently, especially such parts of the picture
as should not appear sufficiently transparent or brilliant;
for the oftener heat is applied to the picture, the greater will be
the transparency and brilliancy of coloring; but the contrary
effect would be produced if too sudden or too great a degree of
heat was applied, or for too long a time, as it would draw the
wax too much to the surface, and might likewise crack the
paint. Should the coat of wax put over the painting, when finished,
appear in any part uneven, it may be remedied by drawing
a moderately hot iron over it again, as before-mentioned,
or even by scraping the wax with a knife; and should the wax,
by too great or too long application of heat, form into bubbles
at particular places, by applying a poker heated, or even a
tobacco-pipe made hot, the bubbles would subside; or such
defects may be removed by drawing anything hard over the
wax, which would close any small cavities.</p>

<p>When the picture is cold, rub it with a fine linen cloth.
Paintings may be executed in this manner upon wood (having
first pieces of wood let in behind, across the grain of the wood,
to prevent its warping), canvas, card, or plaster of Paris. The
plaster of Paris would require no other preparation than mixing
some fine plaster of Paris, in powder, with cold water, the
thickness of a cream; then put it on a looking-glass, having
first made a frame of bees'-wax on the looking-glass, the form
and thickness you would wish the plaster of Paris to be of, and
when dry take it off, and there will be a very smooth surface
to paint upon. Wood and canvas are best covered with some
gray tint, mixed with the same composition of gum-arabic,
gum mastic, and wax, and of the same sort of colors as before-mentioned,
before the design is begun, in order to cover the
grain of the wood or the threads of the canvas. Paintings may
also be done in the same manner, with only gum-water and
gum-mastic, prepared the same way as the mastic and wax;
but instead of putting seven ounces of mastic, and, when boiling,
adding five ounces of wax, mix twelve ounces of gum-mastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
with the gum-water, prepared as mentioned in the first part
of this receipt; before it is put on the fire, and when sufficiently
boiled and beaten, and is a little cold, stir in, by degrees,
twelve ounces, or three-quarters of a pint (wine measure) of
cold spring water, and afterwards strain it. It would be
equally practicable painting with wax alone, dissolved in gum-water
in the following manner: Take twelve ounces, or three-quarters
of a pint (wine measure) of cold spring water, and
four ounces and a half of gum-arabic, put them into a glazed
earthen vessel, and when the gum is dissolved, add eight ounces
of white wax. Put the earthen vessel, with the gum-water and
wax, upon a slow fire, and stir them till the wax is dissolved,
and has boiled a few minutes; then take them off the fire, and
throw them into a basin, as by remaining in the hot earthen
vessel the wax would become rather hard; beat the gum-water
and wax till quite cold. As there is but a small proportion of
water in comparison to the quantity of gum and wax, it would
be necessary, in mixing this composition with the colors, to
put also some fair water. Should the composition be so made
as to occasion the ingredients to separate in the bottle, it will
become equally serviceable, if shaken before used, to mix with
the colors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1379. <em>The Best Season for Painting Houses.</em>&mdash;The outside
of buildings should be painted during autumn or winter. Hot
weather injures the paint by drying in the oil too quickly;
then the paint will easily rub off. But when the paint is
laid on during cold weather, it hardens in drying, and is firmly
set.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1380. <em>A cheap and simple Process for Painting on Glass, sufficient
for the purpose of making a Magic Lanthorn.</em>&mdash;Take good
clear resin, any quantity, melt it in an iron pot; when melted
entirely, let it cool a little, and before it begins to harden, pour
in oil of turpentine sufficient to keep it liquid when cold. In
order to paint with it, let it be used with colors ground in oil,
such as are commonly sold in color shops.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1381. <em>To make Phosphorus.</em>&mdash;Two-third parts of quick-lime
(<em>i.e.</em> calcined oyster-shells), and one-third of flour of brimstone,
put into a crucible for an hour, and exposed to the air for an
hour, become phosphorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1382. <em>To make an Illuminated or Phosphoric Bottle, which
will preserve its Light for several months.</em>&mdash;By putting a piece
of phosphorus, the size of a pea, into a phial, and adding boiling
oil until the bottle is a third full, a luminous bottle is
formed; for, on taking out the cork, to admit atmospheric air,
the empty space in the phial will become luminous.</p>

<p>Whenever the stopper is taken out in the night, sufficient
light will be evolved to show the hour upon a watch; and if
care be taken to keep it, in general, well closed, it will preserve
its illuminative power for several months.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1383. <em>To Marble Books or Paper.</em>&mdash;Marbling of books or
paper is performed thus:&mdash;Dissolve four ounces of gum arabic
in two quarts of fair water; then provide several colors mixed
with water in pots or shells, and with pencils peculiar to each
color; sprinkle them by way of intermixture upon the gum-water,
which must be put into a trough, or some broad vessel;
then, with a stick, curl them, or draw them out in streaks to as
much variety as may be done. Having done this, hold your
book, or books, close together, and only dip the edges in, on
the top of the water and colors, very lightly; which done, take
them off, and the plain impression of the colors in mixture will
be upon the leaves; doing as well the ends as the front of the
book in like manner, and afterwards glazing the colors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1384. <em>To Write Secretly on a Pocket Handkerchief.</em>&mdash;Dissolve
alum in pure water, and write upon a fine white handkerchief,
which, when dry, will not be seen at all; but when you
would have the letters visible, dip the handkerchief in pure
water, and it will be of a wet appearance all over, except where
it was written on with the alum water.</p>

<p>You may also write with alum water upon writing paper,
which will not be visible till dipped in water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1385. <em>To keep Insects out of Bird-Cages.</em>&mdash;Tie up a little sulphur
in a silk bag, and suspend it in the cage. For mocking-birds
this is essential to their health; and the sulphur will
keep all the red ants and other insects from cages of all kinds
of birds. Red ants will never be found in a closet or drawer,
if a small bag of sulphur is kept constantly in these places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1386. <em>Of Books, Mental Cultivation, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Our work would
be incomplete, without some reference to mental as well as material
improvement. In truth, we have aimed, throughout this
and a former book,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> to make the connection between the cultivation
of the mental faculties and true household economy
apparent. To work properly, we must think rightly. Science
is as necessary in the kitchen as in the laboratory. The reason
why men cooks are preferred above women cooks, and better
paid, is, the former study their art as a science. Knowledge
is power, in domestic life as well as in the political arena. Let
the woman elevate her position by her learning; let her understand
the nature and influence of her daily employments,
cultivating her taste and refining her manners by the true standard
of moral excellence; thus making her home-pursuits conduce
to the harmony and happiness of the general plan of life
in which she, the wife and mother, is the centre of attraction
and volition, and how important for humanity her sphere
becomes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1387. <em>Choice of Reading.</em>&mdash;Never keep house without books.
Life is not life to any great purpose where books are not. The
<span class="smcap">Bible</span> is indispensable. Out of its treasures of Divine wisdom
all best human wisdom is derived or directed. Then have
other books, as your means permit. If these are rightly chosen,
every volume will be a teacher, a friend&mdash;a fountain, from
whence may be drawn sweet streams of pleasure and profit.
Poetry, story, biography, history, essays, and religious works&mdash;I
name these in the order a child chooses books&mdash;all are needed.
American literature&mdash;that is, books on subjects connected with
our own country, should be first in our reading. Bancroft's
"History of the United States," Sparkes' "American Biographies,"
Lippincott's "Cabinet Histories of the States," Mrs.
Ellet's "Women of the Revolution"&mdash;these should be accessible
to every family in the Union. Read on every subject connected
with your own pursuits and employments. Knowledge
will aid you even in hand labor; and a good book is a safe
refuge in idle hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1388. <em>Of Periodicals and Newspapers.</em>&mdash;Every family should
take a newspaper; this, the lady of the house should insist</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>
<p>upon&mdash;kindly, to be sure; for a pleasant request is as powerful
as "a soft answer" in "turning away wrath." Men, usually,
are willing to subscribe for a paper, though some are indifferent
to this great source of family instruction as well as pleasure;
but they forget, when the year comes round, to <em>renew</em> their subscription
in the right way. So the women of the family should
be sure to remember the printer.</p>

<p>Another important source of family improvement is the periodicals
or monthly magazines. These are now, thanks to the
cheap postage system, accessible to the dwellers in the most
remote places of our wide land. As a work for our own sex,
Godey's Lady's Book is the best that can be taken in a family,
because it furnishes information on every branch of home duties
and pursuits; and moreover, upholds that pure standard
of morals in its lightest fiction, which renders it a safe enjoyment
for the young.</p>

<p>Many other periodicals might be named, all excellent of
their kind, and where the expense can be afforded, each household
should obtain one or more of these. A better way would
be for a neighborhood to unite and take a half dozen different
publications, securing the inestimable advantage of reading
every month the best religious, medical, agricultural, scientific,
literary, and illustrated magazines&mdash;thus keeping up with the
progress of art, the march of mind, the material advancement,
and the moral improvement of the world.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1389. <em>How can we Pay for the Magazines?</em>&mdash;Is the question
with many families. Very easily, if you have the will&mdash;one
half of the money spent on tobacco would, if laid out in books,
soon give every family a library. And, young ladies, if you
cannot persuade your brothers to throw aside their cigars, and
subscribe, why, look over this book, and see, if from its economical
hints you cannot devise some plan of earning or saving,
whereby you may be able to pay for the magazines. Do this
one year; husband or brother will then be ready to aid.
Woman has everything to gain from Christian civilization; she
should lead the way.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1391. <em>Accomplishments.</em>&mdash;These are very desirable for the
household, because the inmates are made happier by refined
and ingenious arts and pursuits, and are fitted to improve the
taste of others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1392. Children and young persons, of both sexes, should
learn as many of these arts as they possibly can without neglecting
duties. Pleasant modes of employing leisure hours
save people from many temptations, and add much to the
happiness of life.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>WATER-COLORS USED IN DRAWING.</h4>

<p>1393. <em>Indian Ink.</em>&mdash;The best is stamped with Chinese
characters, breaks with a glossy fracture, and feels smooth
when rubbed on the plate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1394. <em>Hair Pencils</em> are made of camel's-hair; if they come
to a point, when moistened, without splitting, they are good.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1395. <em>Drawing Paper.</em>&mdash;That made without any wire
marks, and called wove paper, is the best; it is made of various
sizes and thicknesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1396. <em>To make a good White.</em>&mdash;Clarify white lead with
white-wine vinegar. After the powder has settled, pour off
the vinegar, put the powder into a glass of water, stir it,
and pour the water off while it is white into another glass;
when it is settled, pour off the water, and an excellent white
will be obtained. To this add gum enough to give it a gloss.</p>

heightened with white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1433. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Blue verdigris, shaded with indigo, and
heightened with white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1434. <em>To prevent Colors from Cracking.</em>&mdash;Boil two ounces
of the best and clearest glue, with one pint of clear water, and
a half an ounce of alum, till dissolved. With this temper
those colors intended for the sky.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1435. <em>To make a Solution of Gum.</em>&mdash;Dissolve an ounce
of white gum arabic, and half an ounce of double refined
sugar, in a quart of spring water; strain it through a piece
of muslin, and bottle it to keep it free from dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1436. <em>To keep Flies from the Work.</em>&mdash;Having prepared
the gum water for the colors, add a little coloquintida.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1437. <em>To prepare Alum Water.</em>&mdash;Take four ounces of alum,
and a pint of spring water; boil it till the alum is thoroughly
dissolved, and then filter it through blotting-paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1438. <em>To use Alum Water.</em>&mdash;Before laying on the colors,
take some of this water, hot, and with a sponge wet the back
of the paper, which, if not good, must be wet three or four
times, letting the paper dry each time before wetting it again.
This will prevent the sinking of the colors, and give them additional
lustre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<p>1469. <em>Roses.</em>&mdash;A light tint of pure carmine, over which another
equally light of Peruvian blue; proceed with the darker
shades of carmine of the best sort.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1470. In the darkest part of the flower add a little indigo
to give a roundness. If the <em>seeds</em> are seen lay on gamboge,
shaded with gall-stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1471. <em>Leaves.</em>&mdash;Upper side, sap-green, shaded with indigo
and French berries mixed; under-side, white indigo and sap
green mixed, shaded with the same.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1472. <em>Stalks.</em>&mdash;Sap-green and carmine, shaded with indigo.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1473. <em>Rose-buds.</em>&mdash;A pale wash of carmine, shaded with a
stronger wash of the same.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1474. <em>Stalks</em> and <em>leaves</em>, sap green with a slight wash of
carmine.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>BIRDS IN WATER-COLORS.</h4>

<p>1475. <em>Eagles.</em>&mdash;Black and brown, shaded with indigo;
feathers heightened by brown ochre and white; beak and
claws saffron, shaded with bistre; eyes vermilion, heightened
with masticot or saffron, shaded with vermilion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1476. <em>Geese.</em>&mdash;Ceruse shaded with black; legs, black; bill,
red.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1477. <em>Owls.</em>&mdash;Ochre mixed with white, in different shades;
legs, yellow ochre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1478. <em>Pheasants.</em>&mdash;White and black mixed; legs, Dutch
pink, shaded with black.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1479. <em>Swans.</em>&mdash;White shaded with black; the legs and
bills black; eyes yellow; a ball in the midst.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1480. <em>Turkeys.</em>&mdash;Back, black and white mixed, shaded off
to a white underneath; sprinkled and shaded with black.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>LANDSCAPES IN WATER-COLORS.</h4>

<p>1481. Sketch the outlines faintly with a black-lead pencil.
Then color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1482. <em>Colors.</em>&mdash;The most useful are: lake, burnt ochre,
gamboge, indigo, light red, sepia, Prussian blue, sienna, and
burnt umber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1483. <em>The gray color</em> is made of burnt umber, indigo, and
lake; each rubbed separately in a saucer, and then so mixed
in a fourth saucer as to produce the exact color&mdash;a warm
gray. This is thinned for the light tints, as sky and distances.</p>

<p>Deeper is to be used for the shadows and near parts, softening
with water till the exact effect is produced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1484. <em>Buildings</em> are sometimes tinted with a mixture of
lake and gamboge. Burnt ochre is also used. The shadows
have an excess of lake.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1485. <em>Breadths of Light</em> are obtained by destroying the
scattered lights with grays.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1486. <em>Clouds</em> are produced by a thin mixture of indigo and
lake. They should be tinted with sepia. The lower or horizontal
clouds are tinged with ultramarine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1487. <em>Figures</em> are touched with lake and indigo.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1488. <em>Force</em> is acquired by adding sepia to indigo, in the
cold parts, and sepia with lake to the glowing parts.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1489. <em>Grass</em> is washed with a mixture of burnt sienna, indigo,
and gamboge; that in shadow has more indigo. Grass
and bushes may be brought out by a tint of gamboge; distances
may be heightened by lake.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1490. <em>Hills, retiring.</em>&mdash;Tint the whole with weak blue;
then the nearer ones with indigo and lake; add a little gamboge
to the next, keeping one subordinate to the other; the
most distant being lost in the aerial tints.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1491. <em>Land, distant.</em>&mdash;Ultramarine and lake. Ground near
is tinted with ochre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1492. <em>Road and Paths.</em>&mdash;A mixture of lake, burnt umber,
and burnt sienna. It may be tinted with ochre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1493. <em>Smoke.</em>&mdash;Lake and indigo.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1494. <em>Trees, distant.</em>&mdash;Ultramarine, with a wash of indigo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
gamboge, and burnt sienna, tinted with gray. The middle
distance trees have a thin wash of burnt sienna and gamboge.
Nearer trees a wash of burnt sienna, indigo, and gamboge.
In the shadows more indigo is used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1495. <em>Opposing masses of trees</em> are tinted with sepia and
indigo.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1496. <em>Windows.</em>&mdash;Indigo and burnt umber.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>POTICHOMANIE.</h4>

<p>1497. This elegant accomplishment, which has become so
extremely popular and fashionable, promises not only to supercede
altogether many of those meretricious accomplishments
which have hitherto absorbed the attention of our fair countrywomen,
but to rank among the fine arts.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1498. <em>Advantages of this Art.</em>&mdash;It possesses many advantages:
and the process is simple and easily acquired.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1499. It is an exceedingly pleasing and interesting employment,
requiring no previous knowledge of drawing, yet affording
abundant space for the exercise of the most exquisite
taste.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1500. The time employed is richly repaid; the results produced
are of actual value; articles of ornament and domestic
utility being produced, in perfect imitation of the most beautiful
Chinese and Japanese porcelain, of Sèvres and Dresden
china, and of every form that is usual in the productions of
the Ceramic Art.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1501. It furnishes an inexhaustible and inexpensive source
for the production of useful and elegant presents, which will
be carefully preserved as tokens of friendship, and as proofs of
the taste and talent of the giver.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1502. <em>Articles necessary in the Art of Potichomanie.</em>&mdash;Glass
vases (<em>Potiches en verre</em>,) of shapes suitable to the
different orders of Chinese, Japanese, Etruscan, and French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
porcelain, Alumettes, &amp;c.; cups, plates, &amp;c., &amp;c., of Sèvres
and Dresden design.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1503. Sheets of colored drawings or prints, characteristic
representations of the designs or decorations suitable to every
kind of porcelain and china.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1504. A bottle of liquid gum, and three or four hog-hair
brushes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1505. A bottle of varnish, and very fine pointed scissors
for cutting out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1506. An assortment of colors for the foundation, in
bottles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1507. A packet of gold powder, and a glass vessel for
diluting the colors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1508. <em>Directions.</em>&mdash;We will suppose the object selected for
imitation to be a Chinese vase.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1509. After providing yourself with a plain glass vase, of
the proper shape, you take your sheets of colored prints on
which are depicted subjects characteristic of that peculiar
style.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1510. From these sheets you can select a great variety of
designs, of the most varied character, on the arrangement and
grouping of which you can exercise your own taste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1511. After you have fully decided upon the arrangement
of your drawings, cut them out accurately with a pair of scissors,
then apply some liquid gum carefully over the colored
side of the drawings, and stick them on the inside of the vase,
according to your own previous arrangement&mdash;pressing them
down till they adhere closely, without any bubbles of air
appearing between the glass and the drawings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1512. When the drawings have had sufficient time to dry,
take a fine brush and cover every part of them (without touching
the glass) with a coat of parchment size or liquid gum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
which prevents the oil color (which is next applied) from sinking
into or becoming absorbed by the paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1513. When the interior of the vase is perfectly dry, and
any particles of gum size that may have been left on the
glass have been removed, your vase is ready for the final and
most important process.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1514. You have now to tint the whole of the vase with a
proper color to give it the appearance of porcelain; for up to
this time, you will recollect, it is but a glass vase, with a few
colored prints stuck thereon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1515. Select from your stock of prepared colors, in bottles,
the tint most appropriate to the kind of china you are imitating
(as we are now supposed to be making a Chinese vase, it
will be of a greenish hue), mix fully sufficient color in a glass
vessel, then pour the whole into the vase.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1516. Take now your vase in both hands, and turn it round
continually in the same direction, until the color is equally
spread over the whole of the interior: when this is satisfactorily
accomplished, pour back the remainder. If the prepared
color is too thick, add a little varnish to the mixture
before applying it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1517. If preferred, the color may be laid on with a soft
brush. Should the vase be intended to hold water, the interior
must be well varnished after the above operations, or lined
with zinc or tin foil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1518. If the Potichomanist wishes to decorate the mouth
of his vase with a gold border, he can do so by mixing some
gold powder in a few drops of the essence of lavender and some
varnish, applying it on the vase with a fine brush; or he can
purchase gold bands, already prepared for application, in
varied sheets, suitable to the Potichomanie designs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1519. Potichomanists have found the art capable of greater
results than the mere imitation of porcelain vases, by the introduction
of glass panels (previously decorated with beautiful
flowers on a white ground) into drawing-room doors, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
into walls which, being panel papered, offer opportunities of
introducing centre pieces of the same character as the doors;
elegant chess and work-tables, folding and cheval-screens,
panels for cabinets, chiffoniers and book-cases, slabs for pier
and console-tables, glove-boxes, covers for books, music,
albums, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1520. The most common cause of failure is, that the drawings
inside are not thoroughly pressed down.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>GRECIAN PAINTING.</h4>

<p>1521. <em>Grecian Painting</em> is the art of imitating <em>oil</em> paintings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1522. This truly beautiful imitation, if well done, is so perfect
that none save connoisseurs can discern, at sight, the difference.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1523. <em>Engravings</em> best suited to this style of painting are
mezzotint or aquatint, though fine lithographs are used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1524. <em>Rule First.</em>&mdash;Procure a frame one inch longer than
the engraved part of the print.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1525. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Cut the engraving the size of the frame,
then make a stiff paste, and spread it thickly on the frame.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1526. <em>Third.</em>&mdash;Place the engraving face down and sponge
it gently with water; then press the frame firmly and evenly
down on; leave it till entirely dry (not by the fire), and it
will become even and tight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1527. <em>To make the Grecian Varnish.</em>&mdash;Take one part
turpentine, two parts alcohol (90 proof), three parts balsam of
fir, and mix.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1528. <em>To use the Varnish.</em>&mdash;Pour sufficient spirits of turpentine
on the back of the picture to moisten it well, then put
on the varnish and rub it <em>thoroughly</em> with a stiff brush, and
continue to apply it until the picture is perfectly transparent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1529. <em>Spots.</em>&mdash;Leave the picture for twenty-four hours, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
which if white spots appear, showing that the varnish has not
been effectual, repeat the process. Sometimes it has to be
done several times.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1530. <em>Drying.</em>&mdash;Place the picture, face downward, where
it will be free from dust, and leave it three or four days.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1531. <em>Paints.</em>&mdash;These are put on the back of the engraving.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1532. <em>Eyes.</em>&mdash;For blue eyes, permanent blue and white; for
hazel eyes, yellow ochre and Van Dyke brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1533. <em>Flesh Tints.</em>&mdash;Flake white, with a very little vermilion
and Naples yellow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1534. <em>Foliages.</em>&mdash;Chrome yellow and Prussian blue, with
any of the browns.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1535. <em>Sky.</em>&mdash;Clouds touched in with white; the rest permanent
blue and white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1536. <em>Water.</em>&mdash;The light parts with white, the rest the same
as the sky. If a bright scene, and with trees, of a greenish
brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1537. <em>Hair and Eyebrows.</em>&mdash;Yellow ochre and Van Dyke
brown, or raw sienna.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1538. <em>Backgrounds.</em>&mdash;The most agreeable tint is a greenish
brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1539. <em>White Background.</em>&mdash;Flake and silver white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1540. <em>Buff Background.</em>&mdash;Naples yellow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1541. <em>Orange Background.</em>&mdash;Chrome yellow, with vermilion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1542. <em>Blue Background.</em>&mdash;Flake white and Prussian blue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1543. <em>Gray Background.</em>&mdash;White, Prussian blue, and vermilion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1544. <em>Pink Background.</em>&mdash;White and vermilion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1545. <em>Crimson Background.</em>&mdash;Vermilion and white, with
carmine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1546. <em>Green Background.</em>&mdash;Chrome yellow and Prussian
blue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1547. <em>Paints for the Front of the Picture.</em>&mdash;Drying oil
must be used with all the colors on the front.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1548. <em>Shading for the Flesh on the Front.</em>&mdash;Carmine and
Van Dyke brown laid on lightly, and the edges touched off
with the finger.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1549. <em>Cheeks.</em>&mdash;Carmine; soften the edges carefully.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1550. <em>Lips.</em>&mdash;Carmine, with a touch of vermilion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1551. <em>Hair and Eyebrows.</em>&mdash;Yellow lake and Van Dyke
brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1552. <em>Draperies.</em>&mdash;These are always painted on the back,
and shaded on the front with Van Dyke brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1553. <em>Backgrounds.</em>&mdash;If plain, glaze with yellow lake.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1554. <em>Foliages.</em>&mdash;Yellow lake and Van Dyke brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1555. <em>General Directions.</em>&mdash;<em>First</em>&mdash;Lay the paint thickly
on the back, and be careful to cover every part, but not to go
over the edges.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1556. <em>Second</em>&mdash;When the painting is finished let it dry four
days, and then cover the front with a coat of mastic varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1557. <em>Materials required</em>, are a palette, palette-knife, flat
varnish brush, three sizes of bristle brushes, three sizes of table
brushes, drying oil, mastic varnish, spirits of turpentine, Grecian
varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1558. <em>Colors used</em> are oil colors in tubes. Those generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
needed are silver white, Naples yellow, yellow ochre, brilliant
yellow, vermilion, Prussian blue, raw sienna, ivory black,
carmine, yellow lake, Van Dyke brown.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1559. <em>If economy</em> is an object, some of the above-mentioned
materials can be dispensed with.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DIAPHANIE.</h4>

<p>1560. This is a beautiful, useful, and inexpensive art, easily
acquired, and producing imitations of the richest and rarest
stained glass; and also of making blinds, screens, skylights,
Chinese lanterns, &amp;c., in every variety of color and design.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1561. In decorating his house, an American spends as much
money as he can conveniently spare; the elegancies and
refinements of modern taste demand something more than
mere comfort: yet though his walls are hung with pictures,
his drawing-room filled with bijouterie, how is it that the windows
of his hall, his library, his staircase, are neglected?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1562. The reason is obvious. The magnificent historical
old stained glass might be envied, but could not be brought
within the compass of ordinary means. Recent improvements
in printing in colors led the way to this beautiful invention,
by which economy is combined with the most perfect
results.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1563. A peculiar kind of paper is rendered perfectly transparent,
upon which designs are printed in glass colors (<em><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'vitro'">vitre</span>
de couleurs</em>), which will not change with the light.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1564. The paper is applied to the glass with a clear white
varnish, and when dry, a preparation is finally applied, which
increases the transparency, and adds tenfold brilliancy to the
effect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1565. There is another design, printed in imitation of the
half-light (<em><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'abatiour'">abat-jour</span></em>); this is used principally for a ground,
covering the whole surface of the glass, within which (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
necessary spaces having been previously cut out before it is
stuck on the glass), are placed medallion centres of Watteau
figures, perfectly transparent, which derive increased brilliancy
from the semi-transparency of the surrounding ground.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1566. To ascertain the quantity of designs required,
measure your glass carefully, and then calculate how many
sheets it will take. The sheets are arranged so that they can
be joined together continuously, or cut to any size or shape.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1567. <em>Practical Instructions.</em>&mdash;Choose a fine day for the
operation, as the glass should be perfectly dry and unaffected
by the humidity of the atmosphere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1568. Of course, if you have a choice, it is more <em>convenient</em>
to work on your glass before it is fixed in the frame. If you
are working on a piece of unattached glass, lay it on a <em>flat</em>
table (a marble slab is preferable), over which you must previously
lay a piece of baize or cloth to keep the glass steady.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1569. The glass being thus fixed, clean and polish the side
on which you intend to operate (in windows this is the inner
side), then with your brush lay on it very equably a good
coat of the prepared varnish; let this dry for <em>an hour</em>, more
or less, according to the dryness of the atmosphere and the
thickness of the coat of varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1570. Meantime cut and trim your designs <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'carefuly'">carefully</span> to fit
the glass (if it is one entire transparent sheet you will find it
little trouble); then lay them on a piece of paper, face downwards,
and damp the back of them with a sponge, applied
several times, to equalize the moisture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1571. After this operation, arrange your time so that your
designs may now be finally left to dry for fifteen minutes before
application to the glass, the varnish on which has now become
tacky or sticky, and in a proper state to receive them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1572. Apply the printed side next to the glass without
pressure; endeavor to let your sheet fall perfectly level and
smooth on your glass so that you may avoid leaving creases,
which would be fatal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1573. Take now your palette, lay it flat on the design, and
press out all the air bubbles, commencing in the centre, and
working them out from the sides; an ivory stick will be found
useful in removing creases; you now leave this to dry, and
after twenty-four hours apply a slight coat of the liqueur diaphane,
leaving it another day, when if dry, apply a second
coat of the same kind, which must be left several days: finally,
apply a coat of varnish over all.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1574. If these directions are carefully followed, your glass
will never be affected by time or by any variations in the
weather: it will defy hail, rain, frost and dust, and can be
washed the same as any ordinary stained glass, to which, in
some respects, it is even superior.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1575. It is impossible to enumerate the variety of articles
to the manufacture of which Diaphanie may be successfully
applied, as it is not confined to glass, but can be done on
silk, parchment, paper, linen, &amp;c., <em>after they have been made
transparent</em>, which may be accomplished in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1576. Stretch your paper, or whatever it may be, on a frame
or drawing board, then apply two successive coats (a day between
each,) of diaphanous liquor, and after leaving it to dry
for <em>several</em> days, cover it with a thin layer of very clear size,
and when dry it will be in a fit state to receive the coat of varnish
and the designs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1577. Silk, linen, or other stuffs, should be more carefully
stretched, and receive a thicker coat of size than paper or
parchment; the latter may be strained on a drawing or any
other smooth board, by damping the sheet, and after pasting
the edges, stretching it down while damp. Silk, linen, and
other stuffs require to be carefully stretched on a knitting or
other suitable frame.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1578. Take great care to allow, <em>whatever you use</em>, time to
dry before applying the liqueur diaphane.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1579. All kinds of screens, lamp-shades, and glasses, lanterns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
&amp;c., &amp;c., may be made in this way, as heat will produce
no effect upon them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1580. The transparent pictures are successful, because they
may be hung on a window frame or removed at will, and the
window blinds are far superior to any thing of that kind that
have yet been seen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1581. Instead of steeping the designs in the transparent
liquor at the time of printing them, which was previously done
<em>in order to show their transparency to the purchaser</em>, but
which was practically objectionable, as the paper in that state
was brittle, and devoid of pliancy, necessitating also the use
of a peculiarly difficult vehicle to manage (varnish) in applying
it to the glass, the manufacturer now prepares his paper
differently, in order to allow the use of parchment size in
sticking them on the glass.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1582. The liqueur diaphane, which is finally applied, renders
them perfectly transparent. In this mode of operation,
no delay is requisite, the designs being applied to the glass
immediately after laying on the size, <em>taking care to press out
all the air bubbles</em>, for which purpose a roller will be found
indispensable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1583. The designs should be damped before the size is
applied to them. We are of opinion that this art may be
applied to the production of magic-lantern slides, dissolving
views, and dioramic effects; though we are not aware whether
such experiments have been tried.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>FEATHER FLOWERS.</h4>

<p>1584. The art of making feather flowers, though a very easy
and inexpensive accomplishment, and yielding pretty ornaments
for the mantel-piece or the chiffonier, is but little
pursued.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1585. Many persons are under the impression that they
can only be made from the feathers of exotic birds, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
these are expensive. But the following instructions will dispel
this misconception, and remove the difficulty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1586. Procure the best white geese or swans' feathers, have
them plucked off the fowl with care not to break the web, free
them from down, except a small quantity on the shaft of the
feather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1587. Having procured two good specimens of the flower
you wish to imitate, carefully pull off the petals of one, and,
with a piece of tissue paper, cut out the shape of each size,
taking care to leave the shaft of the feather at least half an
inch longer than the petal of the flower.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1588. Carefully bend the feather with the thumb and finger
to the proper shape; mind not to break the web.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1589. <em>To make the Stem and Heart of a Flower.</em>&mdash;Take
a piece of wire six inches long: across the top lay a small
piece of cotton wool, turn the wire over it, and wind it round
until it is the size of the heart or centre of the flower you are
going to imitate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1590. If a single flower, cover it with paste or velvet of the
proper color, and round it must be arranged the stamens;
these are made of fine India silk, or feathers may be used for
this purpose.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1591. After the petals have been attached, the silk or feather
is dipped into gum, and then into the farina. Place the
petals round, one at a time, and wind them on with Moravian
cotton, No. 4; arrange them as nearly like the flower you
have for a copy as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1592. Cut the stems of the feathers even, and then make the
calix of feathers, cut like the pattern or natural flower. For
the small flowers, the calix is made with paste. Cover the
stems with paper or silk the same as the flowers; the paper
must be cut in narrow strips, about a quarter of an inch wide.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1593. <em>To make the Pastes of the Calix, Hearts, and Buds
of Flowers.</em>&mdash;Take common white starch, and mix it with gum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
water until it is the substance of thick treacle; color it with
the dyes used for the feathers, and keep it from the air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1594. <em>To make the Farina.</em>&mdash;Use common ground rice,
mixed into a stiff paste with any dye; dry it before the fire,
and when quite hard, pound it to a fine powder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1595. The buds, berries, and hearts of some double flowers
are made with cotton wool, wound around wire, moulded to
the shape with thumb and finger.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1596. Smooth it over with gum water, and when dry cover
the buds, berries, or calix with the proper colored pastes;
they will require one or two coats, and may be shaded with a
little paint, and then gummed and left to dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1597. Flowers of two or more shades or colors are variegated
with water-colors, mixed with lemon-juice, ultra-marine
and chrome for blue, and gold may also be used in powder,
mixed with lemon-juice and gum water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1598. The materials required are some good white goose
or swan's feathers; a little fine wire, different sizes; a few
skeins of fine floss silk, some good cotton wool or wadding, a
reel of No. 4 Moravian cotton, a skein of India silk, the starch
and gum for pastes, and a pair of small sharp scissors, a few
sheets of colored silk paper, and some water-colors, with the
following dyes:&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1599. <em>To Dye Feathers Blue.</em>&mdash;Into two pennyworths of
oil of vitriol, mix two pennyworths of the best indigo in powder;
let it stand a day or two; when wanted shake it well,
and into a quart of boiling water put one tablespoonful of the
liquid.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1600. Stir it well, put the feathers in, and let them simmer
a few minutes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1601. <em>Yellow.</em>&mdash;Put a tablespoonful of the best turmeric into
a quart of boiling water; when well mixed, put in the feathers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1602. More or less of the turmeric will give them different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
shades, and a very small quantity of soda will give them an
orange hue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1603. <em>Green.</em>&mdash;Mix the indigo liquor with turmeric, and
pour boiling water over it; let the feathers simmer in the dye
until they have acquired the shade you want them. (See
289.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1604. <em>Pink.</em>&mdash;Three good pink saucers in a quart of boiling
water, with a small quantity of cream of tartar. If a deep
color is required, use four saucers. Let the feathers remain
in the dye several hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1605. <em>Red.</em>&mdash;Into a quart of boiling water dissolve a teaspoonful
of cream of tartar, put in one tablespoonful of prepared
cochineal, and then a few drops of muriate of tin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1606. This dye is expensive, and scarlet flowers are best
made with the plumage of the red Ibis, which can generally be
had of a bird-fancier or bird-stuffer, who will give directions
how it may be applied.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1607. <em>Lilac.</em>&mdash;About two teaspoonfuls of cudbear, into
about a quart of boiling water; let it simmer a few minutes
before you put in the feathers. A small quantity of cream of
tartar turns the color from lilac to amethyst.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1608. <em>Black.</em>&mdash;Use the same as for cloth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1609. <em>Crimson.</em>&mdash;Dip in acetate of alumina mordant, then
in a boiling-hot decoction of Brazil wood&mdash;and, last of all,
pass through a bath of cudbear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1610. <em>Before the feathers</em> are dyed they must be put into
hot water, and let them drain before they are put into the
dyes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1611. <em>After the feathers</em> are taken out of the dye, rinse
them two or three times in clear cold water (except the red),
which must only be done once. Then lay them on a tray,
over which a cloth has been spread, before a good fire; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
they begin to dry and unfold, draw each feather gently between
your thumb and finger, until it regains its proper shape.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1612. <em>The leaves of the flowers</em> are made of green feathers,
cut like those of the natural flower, and serrated at the edge
with a very small pair of scissors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1613. For the calix of a moss-rose the down is left on the
feather, and is a very good representation of the moss on the
natural flower.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1614. <em>To Preserve Sea-Weed.</em>&mdash;This is a delicate process,
and may be made like beautiful pictures.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1615. <em>First Process.</em>&mdash;Wash the sea-weed in fresh water,
then take a plate or dish (the larger the better), cut your
paper to the size required, place it on the plate with fresh
water, and spread out the plant with a good sized camel-hair
pencil in a natural form. Picking out with the pin gives the
sea-weed an unnatural appearance, and destroys the characteristic
fall of the branches, which should be carefully avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1616. Then gently raise the paper with the specimen out
of the water, placing it in a slanting position for a few moments,
so as to allow the superabundant water to run off: after
which place it in the press.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1617. <em>The Press.</em>&mdash;The press is made with either three
pieces of board or pasteboard. Lay on the first board two
sheets of blotting-paper; on that lay your specimens; place
straight and smooth over them a piece of old muslin, fine cambric,
or linen: then some more blotting-paper, and place another
board on the top of that, and continue in the same
way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1618. <em>The Finishing.</em>&mdash;The blotting-paper and the muslin
should be carefully removed and dried every day, and then
replaced: at the same time, those specimens that are sufficiently
dried may be taken away. Nothing now remains but
to write on each the name, date, and locality.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1619. <em>The Specimens.</em>&mdash;You can either gum the specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
in a scrap-book, or fix them in, as drawings are often fastened,
by making four slits in the page, and inserting each corner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1620. This is by far the best plan, as it admits of their removal,
without injury to the page, at any future period, if it
be required either to insert better specimens, or intermediate
species. Some of the larger Algæ will not adhere to the
paper, and consequently require gumming.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1621. <em>Another Way.</em>&mdash;After well cleaning and pressing,
brush the coarser kinds of Algæ over with spirits of turpentine,
in which two or three small lumps of gum mastic have
been dissolved, by shaking in a warm place; two-thirds of a
small phial is the proper proportion, and this will make the
specimens retain a fresh appearance.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>BOTANICAL SPECIMENS, LEAF IMPRESSIONS, ETC.</h4>

<p>1622. The plants you wish to preserve should be gathered
when the weather is dry, and after placing the ends in <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'water, them'">water,
let them</span> remain in a cool place till the next day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1623. When about to be submitted to the process of drying,
place each plant between several sheets of blotting-paper,
and iron it with a large smooth heater, pretty strongly
warmed, till all the moisture is dissipated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1624. Colors may thus be fixed, which otherwise become
pale, or nearly white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1625. Some plants require more moderate heat than others,
and herein consists the nicety of the experiment; but I have
generally found, that if the iron be not too hot, and is passed
rapidly, yet carefully, over the surface of the blotting-paper,
it answers the purpose equally well with plants of almost every
variety of hue and thickness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1626. In compound flowers, with those also of a stubborn
and solid form as the Centaurea, some little art is required in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
cutting away the under part, by which means the profile and
forms of the flowers will be more distinctly exhibited.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1627. This is especially necessary, when the method employed
by Major Velley is adopted: viz., to fix the flowers
and fructification down with gum upon the paper previous to
ironing, by which means they become almost incorporated
with the surface.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1628. When this very delicate process is attempted, blotting-paper
should be laid under every part excepting the blossoms,
in order to prevent staining the white paper. Great
care must be taken to keep preserved specimens in a dry
place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1629. <em>Skeleton leaves</em> may be made by steeping leaves in
rain water, in an open vessel, exposed to the air and sun.
Water must occasionally be added to compensate loss by
evaporation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1630. The leaves will putrefy, and then their membranes
will begin to open; then lay them on a clean white plate,
filled with clean water, and with gentle touches take off the
external membranes, separating them cautiously near the
middle rib. When there is an opening toward the latter the
whole membrane separates easily.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1631. The process requires a great deal of patience, as
ample time must be given for the vegetable tissues to decay,
and separate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1632. <em>A more Expeditious Method.</em>&mdash;A tablespoonful of
chlorid of lime in a liquid state, mixed with a quart of pure
spring water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1633. Leaves or seed-vessels of plants to be soaked in the
mixture for about four hours, then taken out and well washed
in a large basin filled with water, after which they should be
left to dry with free exposure to light and air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1634. Some of the largest species of forest leaves, or such
as have strong ribs, will require to be left rather more than
four hours in the liquid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1635. <em>Dwarf Plants.</em>&mdash;Take a cutting of the plant you wish
to dwarf, say a myrtle, for instance, and having set it in a
pot, wait until you are satisfied that it has taken root; then
take a cutting from it, and place it in a miniature flower-pot,
taking care to fill it more than three parts with fine sand, the
remainder with mould.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1636. Put it under a glass on the chimney-piece, or in any
warm place, and give it very small quantities of water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1637. <em>Preserve Fungi.</em>&mdash;Receipt of the celebrated botanist,
William Withering, Esq., by which specimens of fungi may be
beautifully preserved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1638. Take two ounces of sulphate of copper, or blue vitriol,
and reduce it to powder, and pour upon it a pint of boiling
water, and when cold, add half a pint of spirits of wine;
cork it well, and call it "the pickle."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1639. To eight pints of water add one pint and a-half of
spirits of wine, and call it "the liquor."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1640. Be provided with a number of wide-mouthed bottles
of different sizes, all well fitted with corks. The fungi should
be left on the table as long as possible to allow the moisture
to evaporate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1641. They should then be placed in the pickle for three
hours, or longer, if necessary; then place them in the bottles
intended for their reception, and fill with the liquor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1642. They should then be well corked and sealed, and
arranged in order with their names in front of the bottles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1643. <em>Leaf Impressions.</em>&mdash;Hold oiled paper in the smoke
of a lamp, or of pitch, until it becomes coated with the smoke;
to this paper apply the leaf of which you wish an impression,
having previously warmed it between your hands, that it may
be pliable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1644. Place the lower surface of the leaf upon the blackened
surface of the oil paper, that the numerous veins that are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
prominent on this side may receive from the paper a portion
of the smoke.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1645. Lay a paper over the leaf, and then press it gently
upon the smoked paper, with the fingers, or with a small roller,
(covered with woolen cloth, or some like soft material), so that
every part of the leaf may come in contact with the sooted oil-paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1646. A coating of the smoke will adhere to the leaf.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1647. Then remove the leaf carefully, and place the blackened
surface on a sheet of white paper, not ruled, or in a book
prepared for the purpose, covering the leaf with a clean slip
of paper, and pressing upon it with the fingers, or roller, as
before.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1648. Thus may be obtained the impression of a leaf, showing
the perfect outlines, together with an accurate exhibition
of the veins which extend in every direction through it, more
correctly than the finest drawing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1649. This process is so simple, and the material so easily
obtained, that any person, with a little practice to enable him
to apply the right quantity of smoke to the oil-paper, and give
the leaf a proper pressure, can prepare beautiful leaf impressions,
such as a naturalist would be proud to possess.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1650. There is another, and we think, a better method of
taking <em>leaf impressions</em> than the preceding one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1651. <em>Leaf Impressions in Ink.</em>&mdash;After warming the leaf
between the hands, apply printing ink, by means of a small
leather ball containing cotton, or some soft substance, or with
the end of the finger.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1652. The leather ball (and the finger when used for that
purpose), after the ink is applied to it, should be pressed several
times on a piece of leather, or some smooth surface, before
each application to the leaf, that the ink may be smoothly and
evenly applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1653. After the under surface of the leaf has been sufficiently
inked, apply it to the paper, where you wish the impression;
and after covering it with a slip of paper, use the hand or
roller to press upon it, as described in the former process.
(See 711, <a href="#Page_176">page 176.</a>)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1654. <em>Impressions from Coins.</em>&mdash;Melt a little isinglass glue
with brandy, and pour it thinly over the medal, &amp;c., so as to
cover its whole surface; let it remain on for a day or two, till
it has thoroughly dried and hardened, and then take it off,
when it will be fine, clear, and as hard as a piece of Muscovy
glass, and will have a very elegant impression of the coin. It
will also resist the effects of damp air, which occasions all
other kinds of glue to soften and bend, if not prepared in this
way.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4><span class="smcap">TRANSFERRING TO GLASS, WOOD, Etc.</span></h4>

<p>1655. The process of transferring consists in causing the ink
of a print, engraving, mezzotint, or lithograph, to adhere to the
surface of glass, wood, cardboard, ivory, or earthenware, which
is effected by cementing the face of the prints to their surface
by means of some varnish or glutinous transparent body that
will not dissolve in water, and then destroying the texture of
the paper, so as to leave the ink upon the varnish and material
operated on, in the same manner as if the original impression
had been there, but of course reversed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1656. <em>Materials.</em>&mdash;The body to which the print is to be
transferred.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1657. Spirits and oil of turpentine; oil and varnish colors;
seed-lac, white and transfer varnishes; oil of almonds; spirit
of wine; a flat and a round brush, and a towel.</p>

<p><em>The Varnishes.</em>&mdash;The <em>seed-lac</em> and <em>white varnishes</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1658. <em>The Transfer Varnish.</em>&mdash;Take five ounces of the
best spirit of wine, add four ounces of the purified Venice
turpentine to it, and an ounce of picked mastic tears; put
them into a bottle, shake constantly until the mastic and turpentine
dissolve, and in a few hours it will be fit for use,
but improves by keeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1659. <em>To Transfer to Glass.</em>&mdash;Procure a piece of the best
crown-glass, as near as possible in size and shape to the print
to be transferred, varnish it over with a mixture of equal parts
of spirits and oil of turpentine, and lay the print on the glass,
beginning at one end, and pressing it gently down with a
towel in every part in proceeding to the other.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1660. If this is not done carefully, vesicles of air will be
admitted between the paper and glass, and mar the effect.
After pressing the print down with the towel, it is to be set
aside to dry, which will take some time, varying according to
the state of the atmosphere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1661. When the turpentine has become perfectly hard, the
paper must be moistened with water till it is thoroughly saturated,
and the paper entirely removed by rubbing very gently
with the forefinger in a circular direction, and then set aside
to dry, when the impression will be found perfectly transferred,
but reversed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1662. If it is wished to preserve only the appearance of an
engraving, a sheet of white paper or Bristol-board must be
placed behind the glass; but if required to be colored, the
operation must be completed with oil or varnish colors, in such
a manner as may impart to it the semblance of a painting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1663. <em>To Transfer to Wood.</em>&mdash;Procure a piece of wood of
the required form and size; if flat, it should be newly planed,
and rubbed down with pumice-stone and fine sand-paper to
make it perfectly smooth and free from grease; if rounded or
any other shape, it should be scraped with a piece of glass,
then pumiced and sand-papered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1664. Give the wood a coat of transfer varnish previous to
transferring, and set aside for twenty-four hours to dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1665. This promotes adhesion of the print to the wood, and
secures the latter from being soiled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1666. Cut off the white margin of the print, then damp it
by placing it face upward on the surface of some water in a
shallow vessel, taking care to keep the face or printed side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
dry; when properly soaked, pass a sponge over the back,
spread a coat of varnish over the whole of the face, and apply
immediately to the wood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1667. Rub down the whole gently with a towel, in the same
manner as directed for glass, so that it may adhere properly.
When this has been done, and while the back is yet moist, rub
it carefully with the forefinger until half the thickness of the
paper is removed, then leave it to dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1668. Then wet the finger only, and keep rubbing until the
remainder of the paper is removed, and there is a thin white
film over all, allowing the print to appear clean through; then
let it dry, and bring out with a little oil of almonds; after
which apply a coat of carriage-varnish, or the seed-lac and
animi varnish used for white japan grounds, though we prefer
the transfer-varnish ourselves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1669. Great care and patience must be exercised during the
process of rubbing off, to avoid scratching or tearing the
print; if, however, any part is destroyed, it must be repaired
with the same color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1670. In this manner plain or colored prints may be transferred
from paper to wood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1671. When colored prints are transferred, they should be
laid on vinegar and water (two-thirds of the former and one
of the latter), to destroy the size which is in the paper, and
remain twice as long as plain prints; then removed and placed
between blotting-paper, and when the superfluous moisture
has been removed, treated the same as the other prints.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1672. <em>To Clean the Brushes</em> and your hands after using the
varnishes, rub with spirit of wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1673. <em>To Transfer to Ivory.</em>&mdash;Rub well with pumice-stone,
and then transfer in the same manner as directed above.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1674. <em>To Transfer to Card-board.</em>&mdash;Remove the sizing on
the surface by immersing in the vinegar and water mentioned
above, then transfer as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1675. <em>To Transfer to Earthenware.</em>&mdash;Give the article a thin
coating of varnish, then transfer as directed above.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1676. <em>Etching on Glass.</em>&mdash;Mix in a gallipot a little sulphuric
acid and lampblack to a thin smooth paste, and spread
a layer of it on a piece of glass; upon which trace with a
sharp-pointed instrument, (penetrating to the glass,) any design
which may suggest itself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1677. Then dissolve a little fluor-spar, coarsely powdered,
in spirit of turpentine, and with a camel's-hair brush lay some
of the solution upon the parts so traced; let it remain an hour
or two; and you will find, on scraping off the paste, that the
glass will be etched with whatever forms you have traced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1678. Very pleasing drawings may thus be etched upon
glass; and they may be rendered more effective by dusting the
outline with a little vermilion.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>EMBLEMATIC STONES.</h4>

<p>1679. <em>The Jewels of the Months.</em>&mdash;In Poland, according
to a superstitious belief, each month of the year is under the
influence of some precious stone, which influence is attached
to the destiny of persons born during the course of the month.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1680. It is, in consequence, customary amongst friends, and
more particularly between lovers, to make, on birthdays, reciprocal
presents, consisting of some jewel ornamented with
the tutelar stone. It is generally believed that this prediction
of happiness, or rather of the future destiny, will be realized
according to the wishes expressed on the occasion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1681. <em>January.</em>&mdash;The stone of January is the Jacinth, or
Garnet, which denotes constancy and fidelity in any sort of
engagement.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1682. <em>February.</em>&mdash;The Amethyst, a preservative against violent
passions, and an assurance of peace of mind and sincerity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1683. <em>March.</em>&mdash;The Bloodstone is the stone of courage and
wisdom in perilous undertakings, and firmness in affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />

<p>1692. <em>December.</em>&mdash;The Turquoise is the stone which expresses
great sureness and prosperity in love, and in all the
circumstances of life.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>STAINING.</h4>

<p>1693. <em>General Observations.</em>&mdash;When <em>alabaster</em>, <em>marble</em>, and
other <em>stones</em>, are colored, and the stain is required to be deep,
it should be poured on boiling-hot, and brushed equally over
every part if made with water; if with spirit, it should be applied
cold, otherwise the evaporation, being too rapid, would
leave the coloring matter on the surface, without any, or very
little, being able to penetrate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1694. In grayish or brownish stones, the stain will be wanting
in brightness, because the natural color combines with the
stain; therefore, if the stone be of a pure color, the result will
be a combination of the color and stain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1695. <em>Bone or Ivory.</em>&mdash;In staining bone or ivory, the colors
will take better before than after polishing; and if any dark
spots appear, they should be rubbed with chalk, and the article
dyed again to produce uniformity of shade. On removal from
the boiling-hot dye-bath, the bone should be immediately
plunged into cold water, to prevent cracks from the heat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1696. <em>Paper or Parchment</em> is stained; a broad varnish brush
should be employed to lay the coloring on evenly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1697. <em>Wood.</em>&mdash;When the stains for wood are required to be
very strong, it is better to soak and <em>not</em> brush them; therefore
if for inlaying or fine work, the wood should be previously
split or sawn into proper thicknesses, and when directed to be
brushed several times over with the stains, it should be allowed
to dry between each coating.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1698. <em>To Varnish.</em>&mdash;When it is wished to render any of the
stains more durable and beautiful, the work should be well
rubbed with Dutch or common rushes after it is colored, and
then varnished with seed-lac varnish, or if a better appearance
is desired, with three coats of the same, or shellac varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1699. <em>Common Work</em> only requires frequent rubbing with
linseed oil and woolen rags. The remainder, with the exception
of <em>glass</em>, will be treated of in this paper.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1700. <em>Alabaster, Marble and Stone</em>, may be stained of a
yellow, red, green, blue, purple, black, or any of the compound
colors, by the stains used for wood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1701. <em>Bone and Ivory.</em>&mdash;<em>Black.</em>&mdash;Lay the articles for several
hours in a strong solution of nitrate of silver, and expose to
the light.</p>

desired color is obtained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1706. <em>Red.</em>&mdash;Dip the articles first in the tin mordant used
in dyeing, and then plunge into a hot decoction of Brazil
wood&mdash;half a pound to a gallon of water&mdash;or cochineal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1707. Steep in red ink until sufficiently stained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1708. <em>Scarlet.</em>&mdash;Use lac-dye instead of the preceding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

in a decoction of logwood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1710. <em>Yellow.</em>&mdash;Impregnate with nitro-hydrochlorate of tin,
and then digest with heat in a strained decoction of fustic.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1711. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Steep for twenty-four hours in a strong solution
of the neutral chromate of potash, and then plunge for
some time in a boiling solution of acetate of lead.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1712. <em>Third.</em>&mdash;Boil the articles in a solution of alum&mdash;a
pound to half a gallon&mdash;and then immerse for half an hour in
the following mixture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1713. Take half a pound of turmeric, and a quarter of a
pound of pearlash; boil in a gallon of water. When taken
from this, the bone must be again dipped in the alum solution.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1714. <em>Horn</em> must be treated in the same manner as bone
and ivory for the various colors given under that heading.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1715. <em>In Imitation of Tortoise-Shell.</em>&mdash;First steam and then
press the horn into proper shapes, and afterward lay the following
mixture on with a small brush, in imitation of the
mottle of tortoise-shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1716. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Take equal parts of quick lime and litharge,
and mix with strong soap-lees; let this remain until it is
thoroughly dry, brush off, and repeat two or three times, if
necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1717. Such parts as are required to be of a reddish brown,
should be covered with a mixture of whiting and the stain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1718. <em>Iron.</em>&mdash;<em>Black, for Ship's Guns, Shot, etc.</em>&mdash;To one
gallon of vinegar add a quarter of a pound of iron rust, let it
stand for a week; then add a pound of dry lamp-black, and
three-quarters of a pound of copperas; stir it up for a couple
of days.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1719. Lay five or six coats on the gun, &amp;c., with a sponge,
allowing it to dry well between each. Polish with linseed oil
and soft woolen rag, and it will look like ebony.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1720. <em>Paper and Parchment.</em>&mdash;<em>Blue.</em>&mdash;Stain it green with
the verdigris stain given below, and brush over with a solution
of pearlash&mdash;two ounces to the pint&mdash;till it becomes blue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1721. Use the blue stain for wood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1722. <em>Green and Red.</em>&mdash;The same as for wood. (See 717,
<a href="#Page_178">page 178.</a>)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1723. <em>Orange.</em>&mdash;Brush over with a tincture of turmeric,
formed by infusing an ounce of the root in a pint of spirits of
wine; let this dry, and give another coat of pearlash solution,
made by dissolving two ounces of the salt in a quart of
water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1724. <em>Purple.</em>&mdash;Brush over with the expressed juice of
ripe privet berries. The same as for wood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1725. <em>Yellow.</em>&mdash;Brush over with tincture of turmeric.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1726. Add anatto or dragon's blood to the tincture of turmeric,
and brush over as usual. (See 716, <a href="#Page_178">page 178.</a>)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1727. <em>Wood.</em>&mdash;<em>Black.</em>&mdash;Drop a little sulphuric acid into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
a small quantity of water, brush over the wood and hold it to
the fire; it will be a fine black, and receive a good polish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1728. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Take half a gallon of vinegar, an ounce of
bruised nut-galls, of logwood chips and copperas each half a
pound&mdash;boil well; add half an ounce of the tincture of sesquichlorid
of iron, formerly called the muriated tincture, and
brush on hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1729. <em>Third.</em>&mdash;Use the stain given for ships' guns.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1730. <em>Fourth.</em>&mdash;Take half a gallon of vinegar, half a pound
of dry lamp-black, and three pounds of iron rust sifted. Mix,
and let stand for a week. Lay three coats of this on hot, and
then rub with linseed oil, and you will have a fine deep black.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1731. <em>Fifth.</em>&mdash;Add to the above stain an ounce of nut-galls,
half a pound of logwood chips, and a quarter of a pound of
copperas; lay on three coats, oil well, and you will have a
black stain that will stand any kind of weather, and one that
is well suited for ships' combings, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1732. <em>Sixth.</em>&mdash;Take a pound of logwood chips, a quarter of
a pound of Brazil wood, and boil for an hour and a half in a
gallon of water. Brush the wood several times with this decoction
while hot. Make a decoction of nut-galls by simmering
gently for three or four days a quarter of a pound of the
galls in two quarts of water; give the wood three coats of this,
and while wet lay on a solution of sulphate of iron (two ounces
to a quart), and when dry oil or varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1733. <em>Seventh.</em>&mdash;Give three coats with a solution of copper
filings in aquafortis, and repeatedly brush over with the logwood
decoction, until the greenness of the copper is destroyed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1734. <em>Eighth.</em>&mdash;Boil half a pound of logwood chips in two
quarts of water, add an ounce of pearlash, and apply hot with
a brush. Then take two quarts of the logwood decoction, and
half an ounce of verdigris, and the same of copperas; strain
and throw in half a pound of iron rust. Brush the work well
with this, and oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1735. <em>Blue.</em>&mdash;Dissolve copper filings in aquafortis, brush
the wood with it, and then go over the work with a hot solution
of pearlash (two ounces to a pint of water), till it assumes
a perfectly blue color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1736. Boil a pound of indigo, two pounds of woad, and
three ounces of alum in a gallon of water; brush well over
until thoroughly stained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1737. <em>Green.</em>&mdash;Dissolve verdigris in vinegar, and brush
over with the hot solution until of a proper color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1738. <em>Mahogany Color.</em>&mdash;<em>Dark.</em>&mdash;1. Boil half a pound of
madder and two ounces of logwood chips in a gallon of water,
and brush well over while hot; when dry, go over the whole
with pearlash solution, two drachms to the quart.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1739. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Put two ounces of dragon's blood, bruised,
into a quart of oil of turpentine; let the bottle stand in a
warm place, shake frequently, and, when dissolved, steep the
work in the mixture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1740. <em>Light Red Brown.</em>&mdash;Boil half a pound of madder and
a quarter of a pound of fustic in a gallon of water; brush over
the work when boiling-hot, until properly stained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1741. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;The surface of the work being quite smooth,
brush over with a weak solution of aquafortis, half an ounce
to the pint, and then finish with the following:&mdash;Put four
ounces and a half of dragons blood and an ounce of soda, both
well bruised, to three pints of spirit of wine; let it stand in a
warm place, shake frequently, strain, and lay it on with a soft
brush, repeating until of a proper color; polish with linseed
oil or varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1742. <em>Purple.</em>&mdash;Brush the work several times with the logwood
decoction used for No. 6 <em>Black</em>, and when dry give a
coat of pearlash solution, one drachm to a quart, taking care
to lay it on evenly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1743. <em>Red.</em>&mdash;1. Boil a pound of Brazil wood and an ounce
of pearlash in a gallon of water, and while hot brush over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
work until of a proper color. Dissolve two ounces of alum in
a quart of water, and brush the solution over the work before
it dries.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1744. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Take a gallon of the above stain, add two
more ounces of pearl ash; use hot, and brush often with the
alum solution.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1745. <em>Third.</em>&mdash;Use a cold infusion of archil, and brush
over with the pearlash solution used for No. 1 <em>dark mahogany</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1746. <em>In imitation of Rosewood.</em>&mdash;1. Boil half a pound of
logwood in three pints of water till it is of a very dark red,
add half an ounce of salt of tartar; stain the work with the
liquor while boiling hot, giving three coats; then with a painter's
graining-brush form streaks with No. 8 <em>black stain</em>; let
dry, and varnish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1747. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Brush over with the logwood decoction
used for No. 6 <em>black</em>, three or four times; put half a pound
of iron filings into two quarts of vinegar; then with a graining-brush
or cane, bruised at the end, apply the iron filing solution
in the form required, and polish with beeswax and turpentine
when dry, or varnish.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>ORNAMENTED LEATHER WORK.</h4>

<p>1748. An excellent imitation of carved oak, suitable for
frames, boxes, vases, and ornaments in endless variety, may be
made of a description of leather called Basil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1749. The art consists in simply cutting out this material
in imitation of natural objects, and in impressing upon it by
simple tools, either with or without the aid of heat, such marks
and characteristics as are necessary to the imitation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1750. The rules given with regard to the imitation of leaves
and flowers (1887) apply to Ornamental Leather Work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1751. Begin with a simple object, and proceed by degrees
to those that are more complicated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1752. The tools required are ivory or steel points of various
sizes, punches, and tin shapes, such as are used for confectionary.
The points may be made out of the handles of old
tooth-brushes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1753. Before cutting out the leaves, the leather should be
well soaked in water, until it is quite pliable. When dry, it
will retain the artistic shape.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1754. Cut out an ivy or an oak leaf, and impress the veins
upon it; then arrange these in groups, and affix them to frames,
or otherwise.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1755. Leaves and stems are fastened together by means of
liquid glue, and varnished with any of the drying varnishes, or
with sealing-wax dissolved to a suitable consistency in spirits
of wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1756. Wire, cork, gutta-percha, bits or stems of trees, &amp;c.,
may severally be used to aid in the formation of groups of
buds, flowers, seed-vessels, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DYEING.<br />
(<span class="pfs70">SEE PAGES</span> <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, <a href="#Page_75">75</a>, <a href="#Page_76">76</a>.)</h4>

<p>1757. <em>Dye Hair and Feathers Green.</em>&mdash;Take of verdigris
or verditer, of each one ounce: gum water, one pint; mix
them well, and dip the hair or feathers into the mixture, shaking
them well about.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1759. <em>Cleansing Feathers of their Animal Oil.</em>&mdash;The following
receipt gained a premium from the Society of Arts:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1760. Take for every gallon of clean water one pound of
quicklime, mix them well together, and when the undissolved
lime is precipitated in fine powder, pour off the clean lime-water
for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1761. Put the feathers to be cleaned in another tub, and
add to them a quantity of the clean lime-water, sufficient to
cover them about three inches, when well immersed and stirred
about therein.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1762. The feathers, when thoroughly moistened, will sink
down, and should remain in the lime-water three or four days;
after which the foul liquor should be separated from them, by
laying them in a sieve.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1763. The feathers should be afterward well washed in
clean water, and dried upon nets, the meshes of which may be
about the fineness of cabbage-nets.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1764. The feathers must be, from time to time, shaken on
the nets, and as they get dry will fall through the meshes, and
are to be collected for use. The admission of air will be serviceable
in drying.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1765. The process will be completed in three weeks; and
after being thus prepared, the feathers will only require to be
beaten to get rid of the dust.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1766. <em>Dyeing Eggs.</em>&mdash;Wrap the egg in <em>crimson silk ribbon</em>
(taking care that no part is uncovered), tack it on and boil it
five minutes, and when it is divested of the ribbon the shell
will be of a pretty mottled red; any colored ribbon may be
used with a very pretty effect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1767. <em>Crystallization upon Cinders.</em>&mdash;Saturate water, kept
boiling, with alum; then set the solution in a cool place, suspending
a cinder in it, by a hair or fine silk thread; as the
solution cools, a beautiful crystallization will take place upon the
cinder, which will resemble a specimen of mineralogical spar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1768. <em>Staining Grasses and Mosses.</em>&mdash;Take some common
powder-blue, mix with water, rather thin; take dry moss and
dip it in, and let it soak a few minutes, take out and squeeze
it&mdash;you will have a blue moss. Take <em>light</em> chrome yellow (as
there are two sorts), mix with water, as before: with the same
process you will have a yellow moss. Take some of the blue
and some of the yellow, mix with water, as before, and you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
have a green moss. You may have a variety of shades by
adding or diminishing the yellow.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>THE GAME OF DRAUGHTS.</h4>

<p>1769. <em>Rules of the Game.</em>&mdash;The nine laws for regulating
the game of draughts are as follows.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1770. Each player takes the first move alternately, whether
the last game be won or drawn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1771. Any action which prevents the adversary from having
a full view of the men is not allowed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1772. The player who touches a man must play him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1773. In case of standing the huff ten minutes, the other
may call upon him to play; and if, after that, he delay above
five minutes longer, then he loses the game.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1775. In the losing game, the player can insist upon his adversary
taking all the men, in case opportunities should present
themselves for their being so taken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1776. To prevent unnecessary delay, if one color have no
pieces, but two kings on the board, and the other no piece but
one king, the latter can call upon the former to win the game
in twenty moves; if he does not finish it within that number
of moves, the game to be relinquished as drawn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1777. If there are three kings to two on the board, the subsequent
moves are not to exceed forty.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>LAWS OF CHESS.</h4>


<p>1778. The rules given below are based upon the code published
in "<em>Walker's Art of Chess Play</em>." The word <em>piece</em>
frequently includes the <em>pawn</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1779. If the board or pieces be improperly placed, or are
deficient in number (except in the case of odds), the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
must be recommenced, if the error is discovered before the
fourth move on each side (the eighth move of the game.) If
not discovered before this stage, the game must proceed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1780. If the player gives odds, and yet omits to remove the
odds from the board at the commencement, he may recommence
the game, and remove the odds given, provided he discover
his error before playing his fourth move.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1781. But if he has made his fourth move, the game must
be played out; and should the player who agreed to give the
odds win the game, it shall nevertheless be considered drawn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1782. When parties play even, they draw lots for the first
move of the first game. The first move is afterward taken alternately
throughout the sitting, except when a game is drawn,
when he who had the first move in that game still claims it, a
drawn game being of no account.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1783. He who gains the move has also the choice of color.
Each player uses the same color throughout the sitting. When
a match is made for a given number of games, the move passes
alternately throughout the match. A player giving odds has
the choice of men, and takes the move in every game, unless
agreed to the contrary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1784. A player who gives the odds of a piece, may give it
each game from the king's or queen's side, at his option. If
he gives the odds of a pawn, he must give the king's bishop's
pawn, unless otherwise stipulated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1785. The player who receives the odds of a certain number
of moves at the commencement, must not with those moves
cross from his own half of the board.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1786. If a player, in his turn to play, touch one of his men,
he must move that piece, if it can legally move, unless, when
he first touches it, he says aloud, "<em>J'adoube</em>." No penalty is
attached to touching a piece, unless it is your turn to move.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1787. If the player touch his king, with the intention of
moving him, and then finds that he cannot do so without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
placing the king in check, no penalty can be inflicted on his
replacing his king and moving elsewhere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1788. [Otherwise?] If the player should touch a man which
cannot be moved without placing his king in check, he must
move his king instead.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1789. If a player about to move touch one of his adversary's
men, without saying "<em>J'adoube</em>" when he first touches it, he
must take that piece, if it can be lawfully taken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1790. Should it not be taken, he must, as a penalty, move
his king; but should the king be unable to play without going
into check, no penalty can be enforced. It is not allowed to
castle upon a compulsory move of the king.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1791. While you hold your piece you may move it anywhere
allowed by the rules; but when you quit your hold the move
is completed, and must be abided by.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1792. If you inadvertently move one of your adversary's
pieces instead of your own, he may compel you to take the
piece you have touched, should it be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en prise</i>; or to replace it
and move your king, or to leave it on the square to which you
have moved it, and forego any other move at that time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1793. Should you capture one of the adverse pieces with
another, instead of one of your own, the capture holds good,
if your opponent so decides.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1794. If the player takes a piece through a false move, his
adversary may compel him to take such piece with one that can
lawfully take it, or to move the piece that has been touched,
if such move does not expose the king to check, or he may be
directed to move his king.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1795. If you take one of your own men, instead of one of
your adversary's, you may be compelled to move one of the
two pieces touched, at the option of your opponent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

the man you have improperly taken off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1797. An opponent has the option of punishing a false
move, by claiming the false move as your move, by compelling
you to move the piece touched, as you may think fit, or to replace
the piece and move your king.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1798. The king must never be exposed to check by any
penalty enforced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1799. If you move twice running, you may be compelled to
abide by both moves, or to retract the second.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1800. Unlimited time is allowed for the moves [unless otherwise
agreed.] If one player insists upon the postponement
of the termination of a game, against the will of his opponent,
the game is forfeited by him who will not play on.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1801. When a pawn is moved two squares, it is liable to be
taken, <em>en passant</em>, by a pawn, but not by a piece.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1802. If you touch both king and rook, intending to castle,
you must move one of the two pieces, at the option of your
adversary; or he may compel you to complete the castling.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1803. You cannot take a piece and castle at the same time;
nor does the rook check as it passes to its new position; but
it may check on its position after castling.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1804. False castling is liable to the same penalties as a false
move.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1805. When a player gives the odds of a rook, he does not
relinquish the right of castling on the side from which the
rook has been taken, all other conditions being lawful, as if
the rook were in its place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1806. When you give check you must say so aloud.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1807. If check is not called on either side, but subsequently
discovered, you must endeavor to recall all the moves back to
the period when the check first occurred.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1808. You are not compelled to cry check when you attack
the queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1809. If you cry check, and afterward alter your determination,
you are not compelled to abide by the intention, provided
you have not touched the piece.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1810. When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board
it may be replaced by any piece, at the option of the owner,
and irrespective of the pieces already owned by him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1811. <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'Stall-mate'">Stale-mate</span> is a drawn game.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1812. Drawn games count for nothing; and he who moved
first in the drawn game moves first in the following.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1813. If you declare to win a game, or position, and only
draw it, you are accounted the loser.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

move, or committed other irregularity, you cannot claim the
penalties.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1817. Spectators are forbidden to make remarks.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1818. Disputes to be referred to a third party.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>EVENING PASTIME.</h4>

<p>1819. Among the innocent recreations of the fireside, there
are few more commendable and practicable than those afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
by what are severally termed Anagrams, Charades, Conundrums,
Enigmas, Puzzles, Rebuses, Riddles, Transpositions, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1820. Of these there are such a variety, that they are suited
to every capacity; and they present this additional attraction,
that ingenuity may be exercised in the <em>invention</em> of them, as
well as in their solution.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1821. Many persons who have become noted for their
literary compositions may date the origin of their success to
the time when they attempted the composition of a trifling
enigma or charade.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1822. <em>Anagrams</em> are formed by the transposition of the letters
of words or sentences, or names of persons, so as to produce
a word, sentence, or verse of pertinent, or of widely different
meaning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1823. They are very difficult to discover, but are exceedingly
striking when good. The following are some of the most remarkable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1824. <em>Transposed Forms</em>&mdash;Astronomers&mdash;No more stars;
Catalogues&mdash;Got as a clue; Elegant&mdash;Neat leg; Impatient&mdash;Tim
in a pet; Immediately&mdash;I met my Delia; Masquerade&mdash;Queen
as mad; Parishioners&mdash;I hire parsons; Parliament&mdash;Partial
men; Penitentiary&mdash;Nay I repent; Presbyterians&mdash;Best
in prayer; Sweetheart&mdash;There we sat; Telegraphs&mdash;Great
helps.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1825. <em>Conundrums.</em>&mdash;These are simple catches, in which
the sense is playfully cheated, and are generally founded upon
words capable of double meaning. The following are examples.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1826. If a person were looking at a conflagration by the
names of what three great British writers, could he express
his emotions?</p>

<p>1827. <em>Dickens, How-itt Burns!</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1828. The name of what class of persons, in Rome, might
a bear be supposed to say when he was licking his paws after
having eaten a little girl?</p>

<p>1829. <em>Gladiator&mdash;Glad I ate her.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1830. Who first introduced salt provisions into the navy?</p>

<p>1831. <em>Noah, when he took Ham into the ark.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1832. Why need a person never be hungry in the desert?</p>

<p>1833. <em>Because of the sand which is there.&mdash;Sandwiches!</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1834. Why is a clock the most modest thing in the world?</p>

<p>1835. <em>Because it always keeps its hands before its face, and
no matter how good its works are, it will run itself down.</em></p>

Etc.</em></p>

<h4>HOUSEHOLD MAXIMS.</h4>

<p>1836. A short needle makes the most expedition in plain
sewing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1837. When you are particular in wishing to have precisely
what you want from a butcher's, go and purchase it yourself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1838. One flannel petticoat will wear nearly as long as two,
if turned behind-part before, when the front begins to wear
thin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1839. People in general are not aware how very essential
to the health of their inmates is the free admission of light
into their houses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1840. A leather strap, with a buckle to fasten, is much
more commodious than a cord for a box in general use for
short distances; cording and uncording is a disagreeable job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1841. There is not any real economy in purchasing cheap
cottons for gentlemen's night shirts. The cloth cuts in holes,
and soon becomes bad colored in washing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1842. Sitting to sew by candle-light by a table with a dark
cloth on it is injurious to the eye-sight. When no other
remedy presents itself, put a sheet of white paper before you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1843. People very commonly complain of indigestion: how
it be wondered at, when they seem by their habit of swallowing
their food wholesale, to forget for what purpose they
are provided with teeth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1844. Eat slowly and you will not over-eat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1845. Keeping the feet warm will prevent headaches.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1846. Late at breakfast&mdash;hurried for dinner&mdash;cross at tea.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1847. Between husband and wife little attentions beget
much love.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1848. Always lay your table neatly, whether you have company
or not.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1849. Put your balls or reels of cotton into little bags, leaving
the ends out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1850. Whatever you may choose to give away, always be
sure to <em>keep your temper</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1851. Feather beds should be opened every third year, the
ticking well dusted, soaped and waxed, the feathers dressed
and returned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1852. <em>Bed-rooms</em> heated are pernicious to health.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1853. <em>Beds</em>, instead of being made up as soon as people
rise out of them, ought to be turned down, and exposed to
the fresh air from the open windows through the day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1854. <em>Feather beds</em>, especially in youth and in warm weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
enervate the system, destroying its vigor and health. Neither
should beds be too hard. Sleeping with the head under the
clothes is pernicious; so, also, confined air caused by curtains.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1855. <em>The floor</em> is the unhealthiest part of a room, from
the tendency of impure air to descend.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1856. <em>Charcoal</em>, when burning, should have an uncovered
vessel of boiling water over it, the vapor of which will counteract
the deleterious fumes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1857. <em>Powdered charcoal</em> will remove smells, impurities, &amp;c.,
from old glass vessels, after the grosser parts have been scoured
off with sand and potash.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1858. A <em>perfume</em> for linen, &amp;c., is made of rose leaves dried
in the shade, mixed with powdered cloves, scraped mace, and
put in little bags.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1859. Persons of defective sight, when threading a needle,
should hold it over something white, by which the sight will
be assisted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1860. In mending sheets and shirts, put the pieces sufficiently
large, or in the first washing the thin parts give way,
and the work is all undone.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1861. Reading by candle-light, place the candle behind you,
that the rays may pass over your shoulder on to the book.
This will relieve the eyes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1862. A wire fire-guard, for each fire-place in a house, costs
little, and greatly diminishes the risk to life and property. Fix
them before going to bed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1863. In winter, get the work forward by daylight, to prevent
running about at night with candles. Thus you escape
grease spots and risks of fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1864. Matches, out of the reach of children, should be kept
in every bedroom. They are cheap enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1865. Apple and suet dumplings are lighter when boiled in
a net than a cloth. Scum the pot well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1866. When chamber towels get thin in the middle, cut
them in two, sew the selvages together, and hem the sides.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1867. When you dry salt for the table, do not place it in
the salt-cells until it is cold, otherwise it will harden into a
lump.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1868. Never put away plate, knives and forks, &amp;c., uncleaned,
or sad inconvenience will arise when the articles are
wanted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1869. After washing, overlook linen, and stitch on buttons,
hooks and eyes, &amp;c.; for this purpose, keep a "housewife's
friend," full of miscellaneous threads, cottons, buttons, hooks,
&amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1870. For ventilation, open your windows both at top and
bottom. The fresh air rushes in one way, while the foul
makes its exit the other. This is letting in your friend and
expelling your enemy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1871. Never allow your servants to put wiped knives on
your table; for, generally speaking, you may see that they
have been wiped with a dirty cloth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1872. There is not any thing gained in economy by having
very young and inexperienced servants at low wages.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1873. Dirty windows speak to the passer-by of the negligence
of the inmates.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1874. <em>Carpets.</em>&mdash;If the corner of a carpet gets loose and
prevents the door opening, or trips every one up that enters
the room, nail it down at once. A dog's-eared carpet marks
the sloven as well as the dog's-eared book.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1875. <em>Cravats</em> or stocks should not be worn so tight as to
compress the many large blood-vessels of the neck, which connect
with the brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1876. <em>Impure air</em> of theatres, ball-rooms, and other crowded
and badly-ventilated buildings and sleeping-rooms, is poison
to the lungs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1877. <em>Eye-sight</em> is best preserved by a moderate light&mdash;too
little, strains&mdash;too much, dazzles and injures. Bathing in cold
water is of service.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1878. <em>Consumption.</em>&mdash;Remedies.&mdash;Vigorous, daily, but not
violent, exercise, and free exposure to the air, are important.
As the great difficulty in medicine is in reaching the seat of
this disease, frequently inhaling certain fumes may be a means
of healing the lungs. Sitting and sleeping in a room through
which the fumes of resin, turpentine, or other similar gums
are moderately diffused, may be of service.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1879. <em>Small Pox</em> is prevented by vaccination, if well done.
Never neglect vaccination.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1880. <em>Water</em> is purified by&mdash;1, filtration through gravel,
sand, or soft porous stone and charcoal. Or, 2, it may be
sweetened and improved by charcoal, coarsely pulverized and
thrown into a vessel of water. 3, by boiling and distillation.
Water is greatly improved in wells or pumps that are frequently
used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1881. <em>Distilled Water</em>, after being exposed to the air, is the
most salubrious of all drinks, and its daily use is of the greatest
importance in dyspepsia and similar diseases.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1882. <em>Wet Clothes</em> should not be worn near a fire, or so as
to occasion sudden heat. Keep in motion till dry can be
had, then change at once, and give the feet a long heating.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1883. <em>Black Silks</em> wash in warm small beer and milk.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS FOR MANY THINGS.</h4>

<p>1884. <em>To Extract Grease from Clothes.</em>&mdash;Scrape off all the
grease that you can with a knife; then lay over the spot a
thick brown paper, and press it with a warm iron; if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
grease comes through the paper, take another piece, and so
on until it does not soil the paper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1885. If not all out, wrap a bit of cloth or flannel round
the finger, dip it in spirits of wine, and rub the grease spot;
this will take it out. Be careful not to have the iron too hot.
Try it on white paper; if it scorches this, it is too hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1886. <em>To Extract Paint from Woolen.</em>&mdash;Rub the spot with
a piece of flannel saturated with turpentine, or spirit of wine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1887. <em>To Preserve Hats.</em>&mdash;Brush them always with a soft
brush. Keep them in a hat box if not in constant use, as air
and dust soon turn them brown. Have a stick for each hat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1888.&mdash;<em>Hats when wet</em> should be handled lightly, wiped dry
with a cloth or silk handkerchief, and brushed. If the fur
sticks, dampen it with a sponge dipped in vinegar, and brush
it dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1889. <em>When heated by exercise</em> avoid drinking cold water.
Rinse the mouth with cold water before drinking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1890. <em>To Procure Sleep.</em>&mdash;On going to bed take a warm
or cold bath.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1891. <em>Another Way.</em>&mdash;Rub the body well with rough
towels or the flesh-brush for a quarter of an hour.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1892. <em>To Relieve Headache in Bed.</em>&mdash;Wash the head in
cold water, and lay aside the night-cap, but see that the feet
are kept warm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1893. <em>The air bath</em> is very healthful. Children especially
should resort to this method of enjoying the salubrious influence
of the atmosphere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1894. <em>Dr. Franklin's</em> plan was to rise at day-break, and
pass half an hour in his chamber undressed, reading or writing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1895. <em>Close Closets</em> that have become infested with moths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
should be well rubbed with a strong decoction of tobacco, and
repeatedly sprinkled with spirits of camphor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1896. <em>The Sting of a Nettle</em> may be cured by rubbing the
part with rosemary, mint, or sage leaves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1897. <em>Charcoal Fumes.</em>&mdash;The usual remedies for persons
overcome with the fumes of charcoal in a close apartment are,
to throw cold water on the head and to bleed immediately;
also apply mustard or hartshorne to the soles of the feet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1898. <em>An Ever-Dirty Hearth</em>, and a grate always choked
with cinders and ashes, are infallible evidences of bad house-keeping.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1899. <em>Effects of Charcoal</em>, in stopping putrefaction, are
now well ascertained; fish or meat may be restored by boiling
charcoal with them.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>1900. <em>Moths&mdash;to get rid of them.</em>&mdash;Procure shavings of
cedar-wood, and enclose in muslin bags, which should be distributed
freely among the clothes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1901. <em>Second.</em>&mdash;Sprinkle pimento (allspice) berries among
the clothes. Sprinkle the clothes with the seeds of the musk
plant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1902. <em>To Destroy the Eggs.</em>&mdash;When deposited in woolen
cloth, &amp;c., use a solution of acetate of potash in spirits of rosemary,
fifteen grains to the pint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1903. <em>To Drive away Moths</em> from clothes, wrap up some
yellow or turpentine soap in paper; or place an open bottle
containing spirits of turpentine in the wardrobe.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1904. <em>Cold Green Tea</em>, very strong, and sweetened with
sugar, when set about in saucers, attracts flies and destroys
them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1905. <em>For Keeping a Door open</em>, place a large brick, covered
neatly with a piece of carpeting, against the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1906. <em>A Stair-Carpet</em> should never be swept down with a
long broom, but always with a short-handled brush, and a dust
pan held closely under each step of the stairs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1907. <em>A Hat</em> should be brushed every day with a hat-brush,
and twice a-day in dusty weather.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1908. <em>Rings</em> that have stones in them should always be
taken off the finger when the hands are washed, else they become
discolored.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1909. <em>Reading in Bed</em> at night should be avoided, as besides
the danger of an accident, it never fails to injure the
eyes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1910. <em>In Escaping from a Fire</em>, creep or crawl along the
room with your face close to the ground. Children should be
early taught how to press out a spark when it happens to
reach any part of their dress, and also that running into the
air will cause it to blaze immediately. (See <a href="#Page_204">page 204.</a>)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1911. <em>Bronzed Chandeliers, Lamps, &amp;c.</em>, should be merely
dusted with a feather brush, or with a soft cloth, as washing
them will take off the bronzing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1912. <em>Iron Wipers.</em>&mdash;Old soft towels, or pieces of old
sheets or tablecloths, make excellent iron wipers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1913. <em>To Clean Looking-Glasses.</em>&mdash;First wash the glass
all over with lukewarm soap-suds and a sponge. When dry,
rub it bright with a buckskin and a little prepared chalk, finely
powdered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1914. <em>Flowers and Shrubs</em> should be excluded from a bed-chamber.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1915. <em>Water</em> of every kind, except rain water, will speedily
cover the inside of a tea-kettle with an unpleasant crust; this
may easily be guarded against by placing a clean oyster-shell
in the tea-kettle, which will always keep it in good order, by
attracting the particles of earth or of stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1916. <em>Paper Fire-Screens</em> should be coated with transparent
varnish; otherwise they will soon become soiled and discolored.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1917. <em>The best Lamp-Oil</em> is that which is clear and nearly
colorless, like water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1918. <em>Oil-Grease</em> may be removed from a hearth by covering
it immediately with thick hot ashes, or with burning coals.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1919. <em>Candles</em> improve by keeping a few months.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1920. <em>Glass Vessels</em>, and other utensils, may be purified
and cleaned by rinsing them out with powdered charcoal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1921. <em>Family Clocks</em> ought only to be oiled with the very
purest oil, purified by a quart of lime-water to a gallon of oil,
in which it has been well shaken, and suffered to stand for
three or four days, when it may be drawn off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1922. <em>To Heat a Bed</em> at a moment's notice, throw a little
salt into the warming-pan, and suffer it to burn for a minute
previous to use. (See page <a href="#Page_17">17</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1923. <em>To Destroy Flies</em> in a room, take half a teaspoonful
of black pepper in powder, one teaspoonful of brown sugar,
and one tablespoonful of cream, mix them well together, and
place them in the room on a plate, where the flies are troublesome.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1924. <em>Feet, to Keep Warm in a Carriage or Cold Room.</em>&mdash;Use
a stone or glass bottle filled with boiling water and
wrapped in flannel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1925. <em>To Prevent Cold Feet at Night.</em>&mdash;Rub the ankles
and feet with the hand as hard as can be borne for five or ten
minutes before retiring. This will be found an effectual
remedy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1926. <em>Another Way.</em>&mdash;Frequent washing, and rubbing them
thoroughly dry, with a linen cloth, or flannel, is useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1927. <em>To Warm Beds.</em>&mdash;Take all the black or blazing coals
out of the pan, and scatter a little salt over the remainder.
This will prevent the smell of sulphur.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1928. <em>To Explore Unventilated Places.</em>&mdash;Light sheets of
brown paper and throw into the well or cavern. Or, fix a
long pipe to a pair of bellows, and blow into the place for
some time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1929. <em>To Destroy Crickets.</em>&mdash;Put Scotch snuff upon the
holes where they come out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1930. <em>To Brush Clothes.</em>&mdash;Have a wooden horse to put the
clothes on, and a small cane to beat the dust out of them;
also a board or table long enough for them to be put their
whole length while brushing them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1931. Have two brushes, one hard and the other soft. Use
the hard brush for the great coats; the soft for the fine cloth
garments. These should never be brushed with too hard a
brush, as this will take off the nap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1932. <em>The Cane for the Clothes</em> should not be too large.
A small hand-whip is the best to beat with. Be careful not
to strike the buttons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1933. If the coat be wet and spotted with mud, let it be
quite dry before brushing it. Then rub off the mud with the
hands; put the coat at its full length on the board, and brush
the cloth the same way the nap goes, which is toward the
skirt of the coat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1934. <em>Chimneys, Smoky, to Cure.</em>&mdash;A northern aspect often
produces a smoky chimney.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1935. <em>Stacks of Chimneys</em> are less apt to smoke than single
ones.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1936. <em>Straight Funnels</em> seldom draw well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1937. <em>Large Fire-Places</em> are apt to smoke. When they do
so, the lower aperture should be diminished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1938. If the <em>chimney</em> smokes only when the fire is first lighted,
lay any inflammable substance, as shavings, on the top of the
grate; the rapid combustion of which will warm the air of the
chimney, and give it a tendency upward before any smoke is
produced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1939. A <em>chimney so incorrigible</em> as to require the constant
admission of fresh air, should have a pipe introduced, one of
whose apertures is under the grate, and the other in the open
air. Or openings may be made for ventilation near the top
of the apartment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1940. <em>To prevent unpleasant odor in Clothes laid up for a
time</em>, place recently-made charcoal between the folds of the
garments. Even when the odor has taken place, the charcoal
will absorb it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1941. <em>To Purify Stagnant Water.</em>&mdash;One part of chalk and
two of alum will speedily purify stagnant water, and four parts
of animal carbon and one of alum are sufficient to purify a
thousand parts of muddy river water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1942. <em>To Prevent the Smoking of a Lamp.</em>&mdash;Soak the wick
in strong vinegar, and well dry it before you use it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1943. <em>To Clean Cane Chairs.</em>&mdash;Sponge them, until soaked,
with soap and hot water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1944. <em>Clean White Vails.</em>&mdash;Put the vail in a solution of
white soap, and let it simmer a quarter of an hour; squeeze it
in some warm water and soap till quite clean. Rinse it from
soap, and then in clean cold water, in which is a drop of liquid
blue; then pour boiling water on a teaspoonful of starch, run
the vail through this, and clear it well by clapping it. Afterward
pin it out, keeping the edges straight and even.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1945. <em>Restoring Color to Silk.</em>&mdash;When the color has been
taken from silk by acids, it may be restored by applying to
the spot a little hartshorne, or sal-volatile.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1946. <em>Clean White Ostrich Feathers.</em>&mdash;Four ounces of white
soap, cut small, dissolved in four pints of water, rather hot, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
a large basin; make the solution into a lather, by beating it
with birch-rods, or wires.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1947. Introduce the feathers, and rub well with the hands
for five or six minutes. After this soaping, wash in clean
water, as hot as the hand can bear. Shake until dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1948. <em>Cure for a Burn.</em>&mdash;Wheat flour and cold water
mixed to the consistency of soft paste, is an almost instantaneous
cure for a burn, whether large or small. Renew before
the first gets so dry as to stick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1949. <em>Slippery Elm</em> bark powdered makes an excellent
healing poultice for burns, sores, &amp;c., boiled with milk and
about one-third bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1950. <em>Cod-Liver Oil.</em>&mdash;This is a nauseating medicine, but
the following receipt is said to remedy the bad taste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1951. To a pint of cod-liver oil add an ounce of fine salt;
shake them well together, till they amalgamate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1952. <em>To Dress Squirrel and other Skins.</em>&mdash;Take a handful
of common salt, and half the quantity of alum; boil it in
half a gallon of water till dissolved. When cold, the skins
may be put in to steep, and allowed to remain for a fortnight,
occasionally turning them; they may then be taken out,
stretched on a board (skin side outward) till dry; they will
then be found perfectly soft and pliable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1953. <em>Another Method.</em>&mdash;Stretch the fresh skin on a board,
and dress it with water in which salt and alum have been dissolved&mdash;applying
the solution with a brush. This does not
injure the glossiness of the fur, which is apt to be affected
when the skin is immersed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1954. <em>To Clean Furs.</em>&mdash;Strip the fur articles of their stuffing
and binding, and lay them as much as possible in a flat
position.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1955. They must then be subjected to a very brisk brushing,
with a stiff clothes-brush; after this, any moth-eaten parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
must be cut out, and be neatly replaced by new bits of fur to
match.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1956. <em>Sable, Chinchilla, Squirrel, Fitch</em>, &amp;c., should be
treated as follows: Warm a quantity of new bran in a pan,
taking care that it does not burn, to prevent which it must be
actively stirred.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1957. When well warmed, rub it thoroughly into the fur
with the hand. Repeat this two or three times; then shake
the fur, and give it another sharp brushing until free from
dust.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1958. <em>White Furs, Ermine, &amp;c.</em>, may be cleaned as follows:
Lay the fur on the table, and rub it well with bran made moist
with warm water; rub until quite dry, and afterward with dry
bran. The wet bran should be put on with flannel, and the
dry with a piece of book-muslin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1959. <em>The Light Furs</em>, in addition to the above, should be
well rubbed with magnesia, or a piece of book-muslin, after
the bran process.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1960. <em>Stretching Furs.</em>&mdash;Furs are usually much improved
by stretching, which may be managed as follows: To a pint
of soft water add three ounces of salt, dissolve; with this solution
sponge the inside of the skin (taking care not to wet the
fur), until it becomes thoroughly saturated; then lay it carefully
on a board with the fur side downward, in its natural
disposition; then stretch, as much as it will bear, to the required
shape, and fasten with small tacks. The drying may
be quickened by placing the skin a little distance from the fire
or stove.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1961. <em>To Preserve Furs from Moths.</em>&mdash;Warm water, one
pint; corrosive sublimate, twelve grains. If washed with
this, and afterward dried, furs are safe from moth. Care
should be taken to label the liquid "poison."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1962. <em>To Keep away Flies.</em>&mdash;No fly will enter a room in
which a wreath of walnut leaves has been hung up. The experiment
is worth trying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1963. <em>Washing.</em>&mdash;The most important department of domestic
economy naturally includes the washhouse, into which
philosophy has found its way for the application of many useful
principles, and much useful practice. (See <a href="#Page_262">p. 262.</a>)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1964. <em>To Clean Morocco Shoes.</em>&mdash;Dissolve gum arabic in
water, and mix with it a little white sugar. If it is to be kept
any time, put in a little spirits of wine. Brush the shoes
with it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1965. <em>Cheap Door-Mats.</em>&mdash;Cut old broadcloth or any
woolen articles into long strips from one to two inches broad.
Braid three of these together, and sew the braid round in
gradually increasing circles till large enough.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>WISE ECONOMY.</h4>

<p>1966. If you have a strip of land, do not throw away soap-suds.
Both ashes and soap-suds are good manure for bushes
and young plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1967. <em>Woolen Clothes</em> should be washed in very hot suds,
and not rinsed. Lukewarm water shrinks them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1968. Do not let coffee and tea stand in tin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1969. Scald your wooden-ware often, and keep your tin-ware
dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1970. Preserve the backs of old letters to write upon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1971. If you have children who are learning to write, buy
coarse white paper by the quantity, and keep it locked up,
ready to be made into writing-books. It does not cost half so
much as it does to buy them at the stationer's.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1972. See that nothing is thrown away which might have
served to nourish your own family or a poorer one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1973. As far as possible, have bits of bread eaten up before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
they become hard; spread those that are not eaten, and let
them dry, to be pounded for puddings, or soaked for brewis.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1974. <em>Brewis</em> is made of crusts and dry pieces of bread,
soaked a good while in hot milk, mashed up, and eaten with
salt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1975. Above all, do not let crusts accumulate in such quantities
that they cannot be used. With proper care, there is
no need of losing a particle of bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1976. All the mending in the house should be done once a
week, if possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1977. Never put out sewing. If it be not possible to do it
in your own family, hire some one into the house, and work
with them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1978. Do not let knives be dropped into hot dish-water. It
is a good plan to have a large tin pot to wash them in, just
high enough to wash the blades <em>without wetting</em> the handles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1979. It is better to accomplish perfectly a very small
amount of work, than to half do ten times as much.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1980. <em>Charcoal Powder</em> will be found a very good thing
to give knives a first-rate polish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1981. <em>A Bonnet</em> and trimmings may be worn a much longer
time, if the dust be brushed well off after walking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1982. Much knowledge may be obtained by the good housewife
observing how things are managed in well-regulated
families.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1983. <em>Apples</em> intended for dumplings should not have the
core taken out of them, as the pips impart a delicious flavor
to the dumpling.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1984. <em>A Rice Pudding</em> is most excellent without either eggs
or sugar, if baked gently; it keeps better without eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1985. "Wilful waste makes woful want." Do not cook a
fresh joint whilst any of the last remains uneaten&mdash;hash it up,
and with gravy and a little management eke out another day's
dinner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1986. A warming-pan full of coals, or a shovel of coals,
held over varnished furniture, will take out white spots. Care
should be taken not to hold the coals near enough to scorch;
and the place should be rubbed with a flannel while warm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1987. <em>Sal-volatile</em> or hartshorne will restore colors taken
out by acid. It may be dropped upon any garment without
doing harm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1988. <em>New Iron</em> should be very gradually heated at first.
After it has become inured to the heat, it is not so likely
to crack.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1989. The shanks of mutton make a good stock for nearly
any kind of gravy&mdash;and they are very cheap&mdash;a dozen may be
had for a penny, enough to make a quart of delicious soup.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1990. Thick curtains, closely drawn around the bed, are
very injurious, because they not only confine the effluvia
thrown off from our bodies whilst in bed, but interrupt the
current of pure air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1991. Regularity in the payment of accounts is essential to
housekeeping. All tradesmen's bills should be paid weekly,
for then any errors can be detected whilst the transactions are
fresh in the memory.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1992. <em>Linen Rags</em> should be carefully saved, for they are
extremely useful in sickness. If they have become dirty and
worn by cleaning silver, &amp;c., wash them and scrape them into
lint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1993. If you are troubled to get soft water for washing, fill
a tub or barrel half full of wood ashes, and fill it up with water,
so that you may have ley whenever you may want it. A gallon
of strong ley put into a great kettle of hard water, will
make it as soft as rain water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1994. "<em>Morning's Milk</em>," says an eminent German philosopher,
"commonly yields some hundredths more cream than the
evening's at the same temperature. That milked at noon furnishes
the least; it would therefore be of advantage, in making
butter and cheese, to employ the morning's milk, and to keep
the evening's for domestic use."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1995. <em>Scouring Drops for Removing Grease.</em>&mdash;There are
several preparations of this name; one of the best is made as
follows: Camphene, or spirits of turpentine, three ounces;
essence of lemon, one ounce; mix.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1996. <em>Sweeping Carpets.</em>&mdash;Persons who are accustomed to
use tea-leaves for sweeping their carpets, and find that they
leave stains, will do well to employ fresh cut grass instead. It
is better than tea-leaves for preventing dust, and gives the
carpets a very bright, fresh look.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1997. <em>Economy of Fuel.</em>&mdash;There is no part of domestic
economy which everybody professes to understand better than
the management of a fire, and yet there is no branch in the
household arrangements where there is a greater proportional
and unnecessary waste, than arises from ignorance and mismanagement
in this article.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1998. It is an old adage that we must stir no man's fire
until we have known him seven years; but we might find it
equally prudent if we were careful as to the stirring of our
own.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>1999. Anybody, indeed, can take up a poker and toss the
coals about; but that is not stirring a fire!</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2000. If the consumer, instead of ordering a large supply
of coal at once, will at first content himself with a sample, he
may, with very little trouble, ascertain who will deal fairly
with him; and, if he wisely pays ready money, he will be independent
of his coal merchant; a situation which few families,
even in genteel life, can boast of.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2001. Indeed, we cannot too often repeat the truth, that to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
deal for ready money only, in all the departments of domestic
arrangement, is the truest economy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2002. Ready money will always command the best and
cheapest of every article of consumption, if expended with
judgment; and the dealer, who intends to act fairly, will
always prefer it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2003. Trust not him who seems more anxious to give credit
than to receive cash.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2004. The former hopes to secure custom by having a hold
upon you in his books; and continues always to make up for
his advance, either by an advance price, or an inferior article;
whilst the latter knows that your custom can only be secured
by fair dealing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2005. There is, likewise, another consideration, as far as
economy is concerned, which is, not only to buy with ready
money, but to buy at proper seasons; for there is with every
article a cheap season and a dear one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2006. The master of a family who fills his coal cellar in the
middle of the summer, rather than the beginning of the winter,
will save one-fourth which it would otherwise cost
him; and will be enabled to see December's snows falling
without feeling his enjoyment of his fireside lessened by the
consideration that the cheerful blaze is supplied at twice the
rate that it need have done, if he had exercised more foresight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2007. We must now call to the recollection of our readers
that chimneys often smoke, and that coal is often wasted by
throwing too much fuel at once upon a fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2008. To prove this observation, it is only necessary to
remove the superfluous coal from the top of the grate, when
the smoking instantly ceases.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2009. As to the waste, that evidently proceeds from the
frequent, intemperate and injudicious use of the poker, which
not only throws a great portion of the small coals among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
cinders, but often extinguishes the fire it was intended to
foster.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2010. <em>Economy in Carpets.</em>&mdash;In buying a carpet, as in
every thing else, those of the best quality are cheapest in the
end. As it is extremely desirable that they should look as
clean as possible, avoid buying carpet that has any white in it.
Even a very small portion of white interspersed through the
pattern will in a short time give a dirty appearance to the
whole; and certainly no carpet can be worse for use than one
with a white ground.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2011. A carpet in which all the colors are light, never has
a clean, bright effect, from the want of dark tints to contrast
and set off the light ones.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2012. For a similar reason, carpets whose colors are all of
what artists call middle tint (neither dark nor light), cannot
fail to look dull and dingy, even when quite new.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2013. The caprices of fashion at times bring these ill-colored
carpets into vogue; but in apartments where elegance is
desirable, they always have a bad effect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2014. For a carpet to be really beautiful and in good taste,
there should be, as in a picture, a judicious disposal of light
and shadow, with a gradation of very bright and of very dark
tints; some almost white, and others almost or quite black.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2015. <em>Red Carpets.</em>&mdash;The most truly chaste, rich and elegant
carpets, are those where the pattern is formed by one
color only, but arranged in every variety of shade. For
instance, we have seen a Brussels carpet entirely red; the
pattern formed by shades or tints, varying from the deepest
crimson (almost a black), to the palest pink (almost a white).</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2016. <em>Green Carpets.</em>&mdash;Also one of green only, shaded
from the darkest bottle-green, in some parts of the figure, to
the lightest pea-green in others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2017. <em>Brown Carpets.</em>&mdash;Another, in which there was no
color but brown, in all its various gradation, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
shades being nearly black, others of a light buff. All these
carpets had much the look of rich cut velvet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2018. <em>The Curtains, Sofas, &amp;c.</em>, of course, were of corresponding
colors, and the effect of the whole was noble and
elegant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2019. Carpets of many gaudy colors are much less in
demand than formerly. Two colors only, with the dark and
light shade of each, will make a very handsome carpet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2020. A very light blue ground, with the figure of shaded
crimson or purple, looks extremely well; so does a salmon-color
or buff ground, with a deep green figure; or a light yellow
ground, with a shaded blue figure.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2021. <em>Rugs.</em>&mdash;If you cannot obtain a hearth-rug that exactly
corresponds with the carpet, get one entirely different; for a
decided contrast looks better than a bad match.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2022. We have seen very handsome hearth-rugs with a rich,
black, velvet-looking ground, and the figure of shaded blue,
or of various tints of yellow and orange.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2023. A carpet decidedly light-colored throughout, has a
good effect on the floor, or continues long to look clean.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>THINGS TO KNOW.</h4>

<p>2024. Why do candles and lamps "spirt," when rain is at
hand?</p>

<p>2025. Because the air is filled with vapor, and the humidity
penetrates the wick, where (being formed into steam) it expands
suddenly, and produces a little explosion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2026. Why does a drop of water sometimes roll along a
piece of hot iron without leaving the least trace?</p>

<p>2027. Because (when the iron is very hot indeed) the bottom
of the drop is turned into vapor, which buoys the drop
up, without allowing it to touch the iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2028. Why does a laundress put a little saliva on a flat-iron,
to know if it be hot enough?</p>

<p>2029. Because, when the saliva sticks to the box, and is
evaporated, she knows it is <em>not</em> sufficiently hot: but when it
runs along the iron, it is.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2030. Why is the flat-iron hotter, if the saliva runs along
it, than if it adheres till it is evaporated?</p>

<p>2031. Because, when the saliva runs along the iron, the
heat is sufficient to convert the bottom of the drop into vapor;
but if the saliva will not roll, the iron is not sufficiently hot
to convert the bottom of the drop into vapor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2032. Why do wet feet or clothes give us "cold"?</p>

<p>2033. Because the evaporation absorbs the heat so abundantly
from the surface of our body, that its temperature is lowered
below its natural standard; in consequence of which
health is injured. [This also explains why it is dangerous to
sleep in a damp bed.]</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2034. Why is the health injured when the temperature of
the body is reduced below its natural standard?</p>

<p>2035. Because the balance of the circulation is destroyed,
blood is driven away from the external surface by the chill,
and thrown upon the internal organs, which are oppressed by
this increased load of blood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2036. Why do not sailors get cold, who are frequently wet
all day with sea-water?</p>

<p>2037. Because the salt of the sea retards evaporation; and
(as the heat of their bodies is drawn off gradually) the sensation
of cold is prevented. Also, the salt of the sea acts as a
stimulant, and keeps the blood circulating in the skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2038. What is the cause of snow?</p>

<p>2039. When the air is nearly saturated with vapor, and
condensed by a current of air below freezing-point, some of
the vapor is condensed, and frozen into snow. A few years
ago, some fishermen (who wintered at Nova Zembla), after
they had been shut up in a hut for several days, opened the
window; and the cold external air rushing in, instantly condensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
the air of the hut, and its vapor fell on the floor in a
shower of snow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2040. What is the cause of sleet?</p>

<p>2041. When flakes of snow (in their descent) pass through
a bed of air above freezing point, they partially melt, and fall
to the earth as half-melted snow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2042. What is hail?</p>

<p>2043. Rain which has passed in its descent through some
cold bed of air, and has been frozen into drops of ice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2044. What is rain?</p>

<p>2045. The vapor of the clouds or air condensed, and precipitated
to the earth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2046. Why are rain-drops sometimes much larger than at
other times?</p>

<p>2047. When the rain-cloud is floating near the earth, the
drops are larger, because such a cloud is much more dense
than one more elevated. The size of the rain-drop is also increased
according to the rapidity with which the vapors are
condensed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2048. Why does the Bible say that God "giveth snow like
wool"?</p>

<p>2049. Because snow (being a very bad conductor of heat)
protects vegetables and seeds from the frost and cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2050. How does the non-conducting power of snow protect
vegetables from the frost and cold?</p>

<p>2051. It prevents the heat of the earth from being drawn
off by the cold air which rests upon it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2052. Why are woolens and furs used for clothing in cold
weather?</p>

<p>2053. Because they are very bad conductors of heat, and
therefore prevent the warmth of the body from being drawn off
by the cold air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2054. Do not woolens and furs actually impart heat to the
body?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>2055. No; they merely prevent the heat of the body from
escaping.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2056. Where would the heat escape to, if the body were
not wrapped in wool or fur?</p>

<p>2057. The heat of the body would fly off into the air: for
the cold air, coming in contact with our body, would gradually
draw away its heat, till it was as cold as the air itself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2058. What then is the principal use of clothing in winter
time?</p>

<p>2059. To prevent the animal heat from escaping too freely;
and to protect the body from the external air (or wind), which
would carry away its heat too rapidly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2060. Why are March winds dry?</p>

<p>2061. Because they generally blow from the east or north-east,
and therefore sweep over the continent of America.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2062. What is the use of March winds?</p>

<p>2063. They dry the soil (which is saturated by the floods
of February), break up the heavy clods, and fit the land for
the seeds which are committed to it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2064. Why is it said that "March comes in like a lion?"</p>

<p>2065. Because it comes in with blustering east winds, so
essential to dry the soil, which would otherwise rot the seed
committed to it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2066. Why does "March go out like a lamb?"</p>

<p>2067. Because the water, evaporated by the high winds,
falls again in showers to fertilize the earth, and breaks the
violence of the winds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2068. Why is it said that "March flowers make no summer
bowers?"</p>

<p>2069. Because, if the spring be very mild, vegetation gets
too forward, and is pinched by the nightly frosts, so as to produce
neither fruits nor flowers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2070. Why is it said that "April showers bring May
flowers?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>2071. Because April showers supply the principal nourishment
on which the seeds depend for their development.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2072. Why does a polished metal teapot make better tea
than a black earthen one?</p>

<p>2073. As polished metal is a very bad radiator of heat, it
keeps the water hot much longer; and the hotter the water
is, the better it draws the tea.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2074. Why will not a dull black teapot make good tea?</p>

<p>2075. Because the heat of the water flies off so quickly,
through the dull black surface of the teapot, that the water is
very rapidly cooled, and cannot "draw" the tea.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2076. Do not pensioners, and aged cottagers, generally
prefer the black earthen teapot to the bright metal one?</p>

<p>2077. Yes, because they set it on the hob to "draw;" in
which case, the little black teapot will make the best tea.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2078. Why will a black teapot make a better tea than a
bright metal one, if it is set on the hob to draw?</p>

<p>2079. Because the black teapot will absorb heat plentifully
from the fire, and keep the water hot; whereas a bright metal
teapot (set upon the hob) would throw off the heat by reflection.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2080. Then sometimes a black earthen teapot is the best,
and sometimes a bright metal one?</p>

<p>2081. Yes; when the teapot is set on the hob to "draw,"
the black earth is the best, because it absorbs heat; but when
the teapot is not set on the hob the bright metal is the best,
because it radiates heat very slowly, and therefore keeps the
water hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2082. Why does a saucepan which has been used boil in a
shorter time than a new one?</p>

<p>2083. Because the bottom and back are covered with soot,
and the black soot rapidly absorbs the heat of the glowing
coals.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2084. Why should the front and lid of a saucepan be clean
and bright?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>2085. As they do not come in contact with the fire, they
cannot absorb heat, and (being bright) they will not suffer
the heat to escape by radiation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2086. Why should not the bottom and back of a kettle be
cleaned and polished?</p>

<p>2087. Because they come in contact with the fire, and
(while they are covered with black soot) absorb heat freely
from the burning coals.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2088. Why are dinner-covers made of bright tin or silver?</p>

<p>2089. Because light-colored and highly-polished metal is a
very bad radiator of heat; and, therefore, bright tin or silver
will not allow the heat of the cooked food to escape through
the cover by radiation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2090. Why should a meat-cover be very brightly polished?</p>

<p>2091. If the cover be dull or scratched, it will absorb heat
from the food; and instead of keeping it hot, it will make it
cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2092. Why should a silver meat-cover be plain, and not
chased?</p>

<p>2093. Because, if the cover be chased, it will absorb heat
from the food; and instead of making it hot, will make it
cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2094. What is the smoke of a candle?</p>

<p>2095. Solid particles of carbon, separated from the wick
and tallow, but not consumed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2096. Why are some particles consumed and not others?</p>

<p>2097. The combustion of the carbon depends upon its combining
with the oxygen of the air. Now, as the outer surface
of the flame prevents the access of air to the interior parts,
much of the carbon of those parts passes off in smoke.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2098. Why do lamps smoke?</p>

<p>2099. Either because the wick is cut unevenly, or else
because it is turned up too high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2100. Why does a lamp smoke, when the wick is cut unevenly?</p>

<p>2101. Because the points of the jagged edge (being very
easily separated from the wick) load the flame with more carbon
than it can consume; and as the heat of the flame is
greatly diminished by these little bits of wicks, it is unable to
consume even the usual quantity of smoke. The same applies
when the wick is turned up too high.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2102. Why does a lamp-glass diminish the smoke of a wick?</p>

<p>2103. Because it increases the supply of oxygen to the
flame, by producing a draught; and it concentrates and reflects
the heat of the flame; in consequence of which the combustion
of the carbon is more perfect, and very little escapes unconsumed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2104. <em>Hints about Making Butter</em> (See <a href="#Page_287">page 287</a>).&mdash;Milk
should never be set for butter in a dark, damp cellar&mdash;as in
the case with butter-makers in this section&mdash;as the cream is
thereby moulded before it has had time to rise, which gives
the butter a mouldy taste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2105. The milk is allowed to stand too long before being
skimmed, which gives it a cheesy taste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2106. The cream is kept too long before it is churned, after
it is skimmed, which gives it the taste of the other two; and
also a sour taste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2107. The butter should never be washed in water, because
it takes away that beautiful aroma so essential in good butter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2108. It should never be taken in a person's warm hands,
as the heat melts a certain portion of the globules, which
gives it an oily taste, and makes it become rancid very soon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2109. The milk should be set in good clean tin or earthen
pans, in a dry, open, airy and shady place, above ground, if
possible, although a cellar may be so built, and ventilated, as
to answer the purpose.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2110. It should never be set over twenty-four hours in warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
weather; and for a dairy of three cows or over, the cream
should be churned every morning, and never be kept over
forty-eight hours, in warm weather; in cold weather it may
be kept longer.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>CLEANLINESS.</h4>

<p>2111. The want of cleanliness is a fault which admits of no
excuse. Where water can be had for nothing, it is surely in
the power of every person to be clean.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2112. The discharge from our bodies, by perspiration, renders
frequent changes of apparel necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2113. Change of apparel greatly promotes the secretion
from the skin, so necessary to health.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2114. When that matter which ought to be carried off by
perspiration is either retained in the body, or reabsorbed by
dirty clothes, it is apt to occasion fevers and other diseases.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2115. Most diseases of the skin proceed from want of cleanliness.
These indeed may be caught by infection, but they
will seldom continue long where cleanliness prevails.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2116. To the same cause must we impute the various kinds
of vermin that infest the human body, houses, &amp;c. These
may generally be banished by cleanliness alone.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2117. Perhaps the intention of Nature, in permitting such
vermin to annoy mankind, is to induce them to the practice
of this virtue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2118. One common cause of putrid and malignant fevers is
the want of cleanliness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2119. These fevers commonly begin among the inhabitants
of close, dirty houses, who breathe bad air, take little exercise,
use unwholesome food, and wear dirty clothes. There
the infection is generally hatched, which spreads far and wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
to the destruction of many. Hence cleanliness may be considered
as an object of the public attention.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2120. It is not sufficient that I be clean myself, while the
want of it in my neighbor affects my health as well as his own.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2121. If dirty people cannot be removed as a common
nuisance, they ought at least to be avoided as infectious. All
who regard their health, should keep at a distance, even from
their habitations.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2122. In places where great numbers of people are collected,
cleanliness becomes of the utmost importance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2123. It is well known, that infectious diseases are caused
by tainted air. Every thing, therefore, which tends to pollute
the air, or spread the infection, ought with the utmost care to
be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2124. For this reason, in great towns, no filth of any kind
should be permitted to lie upon the streets. We are sorry to
say, that the importance of general cleanliness does by no
means seem to be sufficiently understood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2125. It were well if the lower classes of the inhabitants of
the United States would imitate the Dutch, in the cleanliness
of their streets, houses, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2126. Water, indeed, is easily obtained in Holland; but
the situation of most towns in the United States is more
favorable to cleanliness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2127. Nothing can be more agreeable to the senses, more to
the honor of the inhabitants, or conducive to their health, than
a clean town; nor does any thing impress a stranger sooner
with a disrespectful idea of any people than its opposite.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2128. It is remarkable, that, in most eastern countries,
cleanliness makes a great part of their religion. The Mahometan,
as well as the Jewish religion, enjoins various bathings,
washings, and purifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2129. No doubt these were designed to represent inward
purity; but they are at the same time calculated for the preservation
of health.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2130. However whimsical these washings may appear to
some, few things would appear more to prevent diseases than
a proper attention to many of them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2131. Were every person, for example, after handling a dead
body, visiting the sick, &amp;c., to wash and to change his clothes
before he went into company, or sat down to meat, he would
run less hazard either of catching the infection himself, or communicating
it to others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2132. Frequent washing not only removes the filth which
adheres to the skin, but likewise promotes the perspiration,
braces the body, and enlivens the spirits.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2133. Even washing the feet tends greatly to preserve
health. The sweat and dirt with which these parts are frequently
covered, cannot fail to obstruct their perspiration.
This piece of cleanliness would often prevent colds and
fevers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2134. Were people to bathe their feet and hands in warm
water at night, after being exposed to cold or wet through
the day, they would seldom experience any of the fatal effects
which often proceed from these causes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2135. In places where great numbers of sick people are
kept, cleanliness ought most religiously to be observed. The
very smell in such places is often sufficient to make one sick.
It is easy to imagine what effect that is likely to have upon
the disease.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2136. A person in health has a greater chance to become
sick, than a sick person has to get well, in an hospital or infirmary
where cleanliness is neglected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2137. The brutes themselves set us an example of cleanliness.
Most of them seem uneasy, and thrive ill, if they be not
kept clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2138. A horse that is kept thoroughly clean, will thrive
better on a smaller quantity of food, than with a greater, where
cleanliness is neglected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2139. Even our own feelings are sufficient proof of the
necessity of cleanliness. How refreshed, how cheerful and
agreeable does one feel on being shaved, washed and dressed;
especially when these have been long neglected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2140. Most people esteem cleanliness; and even those who
do not practice it themselves, often admire it in others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2141. Superior cleanliness sooner attracts our regard than
even finery itself, and often gains esteem where the other fails.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2142. A clean, fresh, and well-ordered house exercises over
its inmates a moral no less than a physical influence, and has
a direct tendency to make the members of a family sober,
peaceable, and considerate of the feelings and happiness of
each other; nor is it difficult to trace a connection between
habitual feeling of this sort and the formation of habits of
respect for property, for the laws in general, and even for
those higher duties and obligations the observance of which
no laws can enforce.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTS.</h4>

<p>2143. The following regulations should be engraved on the
memories of all:&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2144. As most sudden deaths come by water, particular
caution is therefore necessary in its vicinity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2145. Stand not near a tree, or any leaden spout, iron gate,
or palisade, in time of lightning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2146. Lay loaded guns in safe places, and never imitate
firing a gun in jest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2147. Never sleep near charcoal; if drowsy at any work
where charcoal fires are used, take the fresh air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2148. Carefully rope trees before they are cut down, that
when they fall they may do no injury.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2149. When benumbed with cold, beware of sleeping out of
doors; rub yourself, if you have it in your power, with snow,
and do not hastily approach the fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2150. Beware of damps.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2151. Air vaults, by letting them remain open some time
before you enter, or scattering powdered lime in them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2152. Where a lighted candle will not burn, animal life can
not exist; it will be an excellent caution, therefore, before
entering damp and confined places, to try this simple experiment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2153. Never leave saddle or draught horses, while in use,
by themselves, nor go immediately behind a led horse as he is
apt to kick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2154. Ride not on foot-ways.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2155. Be wary of children, whether they are up or in bed;
and particularly when they are near the fire, an element with
which they are very apt to amuse themselves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2156. Leave nothing poisonous open or accessible; and
never omit to write the word "Poison" in large letters upon
it, wherever it may be placed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2157. In walking the streets, keep out of the line of the cellars;
and never look one way and walk another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2158. Never throw pieces of orange-peel, or broken glass
bottles, into the streets.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2159. Never meddle with gunpowder by candle-light.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2160. In trimming a lamp with naphtha, never fill it. Leave
space for the spirit to expand with warmth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2161. Never quit a room, leaving the poker in the fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2162. When the brass rod of the stair-carpet becomes loose,
fasten it immediately.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2163. In opening effervescing drinks, such as soda-water,
hold the cork in your hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2164. Quit your house with care on a frosty morning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2165. Have your horses' shoes roughed directly there are
indications of frost.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2166. Keep lucifer matches in their cases, and never let
them be strewed about.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC HINTS.</h4>

<p>2167. <em>Easy method of Breaking Glass to any required
Figure.</em>&mdash;Make a small notch by means of a file on the edge
of a piece of glass, then make the end of a tobacco-pipe,
or of a rod of iron of the same size, red hot in the fire,
apply the hot iron to the notch, and draw it slowly along the
surface of the glass in any direction you please: a crack will
follow the direction of the iron.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2168. <em>Cleansing of Furniture.</em>&mdash;The cleaning of furniture
forms an important part of domestic economy, not only in
regard to neatness, but also in point of expense.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2169. The readiest mode indeed consists in good manual
rubbing, or the "essence of elbows," as it is whimsically termed;
but our finest cabinet-work requires something more, where
brilliancy of polish is of importance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2170. <em>China and Glass Ware.</em>&mdash;For the best way of cleaning,
see page <a href="#Page_31">31</a>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2171. Much of the red now used in China is actually produced
by the <em>anotto</em> extracted from the cuttings of scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
cloth, which have long formed an article of exportation to
Canton.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2172. It ought to be taken for granted that all china or
glassware is well tempered; yet a little careful attention may
not be misplaced, even on that point.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2173. Ornamental china or glassware are not exposed to
the action of hot water in common domestic use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2174. It will be proper never to apply water to them beyond
a tepid temperature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2175. An ingenious and simple mode of annealing glass has
been some time in use by chemists. It consists in immersing
the vessel in cold water, gradually heated to the boiling point,
and suffered to remain till cold, when it will be fit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2176. Soap and labor may be saved by dissolving alum and
chalk in bran-water, in which the linen ought to be boiled,
then well rinsed out, and exposed to the usual process of
bleaching.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2177. Soap may be disused, or nearly so, in the getting up
of muslins and chintzes, which should always be treated agreeably
to the oriental manner; that is to wash them in plain
water, and then boil them in congee or rice-water: after which
they ought not to be submitted to the operation of the smoothing
iron, but rubbed smooth with a polished stone.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2178. The economy which must result from these processes
renders their consideration important to every private family,
in addition to which we must state that the improvements in
philosophy extend to the laundry as well as to the wash-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2180. <em>Be a Farmer</em>, not a mere earth-scraper, lazily scratching
up sufficient earth to destroy the face of the soil, and
throw seed away, or you will always have to scratch hard for
a living. But make your farm a source of pride, and it will
surely become a source of profit. Make the object to be not
to have <em>many</em>, but <em>rich</em> acres.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2181. <em>Turnip Fly</em> may be expelled by the use of fish-oil,
one or two gallons to the acre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2182. <em>Bone Dust.</em>&mdash;An English proverb says, "One ton of
bone-dust saves the importation of ten tons of grain."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2183. <em>Corn.</em>&mdash;Sprinkling with salt and water will check
the weevil. Of all the grains, corn is the most valuable, taking
into view quantity and price. Soaking the seed in a solution
of saltpetre keeps off the worm, and largely increases the
crop.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2184. <em>Rye</em> is more thrifty on soil of a dry, sandy, or gravely
texture, if well manured, and winters best when sown early.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2185. <em>Lime</em>, as manure for wheat, is of great importance
Use about three bushels to the acre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2186. <em>Fields.</em>&mdash;As a general rule, with but few exceptions,
square large fields are more advantageous than small irregular
ones, requiring less fence, and being more easily watered,
manured, plowed, and harvested.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2187. <em>Musty Grain</em> is made sweet by putting it in boiling
water, (double the quantity of grain), letting it cool in the water,
and then drying it well. Skim the water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2188. <em>A Single Weed</em> may draw out the nourishment that
would have given fullness to half-a-dozen ears. To be free
from taxes is far less important than to be free from weeds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2189. <em>Fences.</em>&mdash;Around each post hill the earth, to carry
off the water, and <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'charr'">char</span> the end a few inches above the surface.
Cedar fences last about 15 years, which should lead
owners to inquire where the fences are to come from hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2190. <em>Manure.</em>&mdash;Every farmer can double the quantity of
his domestic or yard manure, with scarcely any additional expense.
At least fifty per cent. of the nutritive properties of
yard manure are lost by drenching of rains, excessive fermentation,
and injurious application to soil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2191. <em>Plow deep.</em>&mdash;Let a farmer examine the extent and
depth to which the roots of grain, in a loose and favorable
soil, will spread, and he will cease to wonder at the failure of
a crop where the subsoil has never been stirred by the plow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2192. <em>Green vegetables</em>, when put under the soil and submitted
to the process of decomposition, are efficacious in restoring
exhausted soils.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2193. <em>Fertilizing.</em>&mdash;Buckwheat and clover are striking instances
of this power in green crops to fertilize soils, and
both have been extensively used for this purpose.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2194. <em>Agriculture</em> is worthy the most liberal patronage of
our governments, state and national; it ought to be enlightened
by a better (and thorough) education of the agricultural
class.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2195. <em>Three Pillars of the State.</em>&mdash;Agriculture, manufactures,
commerce, stand together; but they stand together like
pillars in a cluster, the largest in the centre, and that largest
is agriculture.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2196. <em>The Civilizer.</em>&mdash;Let us never forget that the cultivation
of the earth is the most important labor of man. Man,
without the cultivation of the earth, is in all countries a savage.
When tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers, therefore,
are the founders of human civilization.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2197. <em>Independence of Farmers.</em>&mdash;We live in a country of
small farms; a country, in which men cultivate with their own
hands, their own fee-simple acres; drawing not only their subsistence,
but also their spirit of independence, and manly freedom
from the ground they plow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2198. <em>The Glory of Agriculture.</em>&mdash;"The task of working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
improvements on the earth is much more delightful than all
the vain glory which can be acquired by ravaging it with the
most uninterrupted career of conquests."&mdash;<em>Washington.</em></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>CATTLE.<br />
(<span class="pfs70">SEE PAGE</span> <a href="#Page_289">289</a>.)</h4>

<p>2199.&mdash;<em>Treat Domestic Animals kindly and tenderly.</em>&mdash;Domestic
animals of all kinds from a horse down to a chicken,
should be treated with gentleness and mildness; men or
boys who are rash and bad-tempered, ought not to be permitted
to have charge of them or to interfere with their management.
Animals that are kept in constant fear of suffering never thrive
well, and they often become vicious and intractable by unkind
and cruel treatment.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2200. <em>Keep Stock in good condition.</em>&mdash;An animal may be
kept short of food in the latter part of the fall or first of winter,
at a small saving of food but at a loss in the condition of
the animal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2201. <em>Stables and Food.</em>&mdash;Provide comfortable sheds and
stables. Remember that a <em>want of comfort is always a waste
of flesh</em>. Give a sufficiency of food and drink, with great regularity.
A meal ten minutes later than the usual time, causes
the animal to fret, and fretting lessens flesh.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2202. <em>Drink and Litter.</em>&mdash;Most animals will drink several
times a day, and should therefore have it as often as they want
it. They should have plenty of clean litter as often as needed.
With such management, there will be an almost incredible
saving of food.</p>

<p><em>Tight Stables</em> should always be ventilated. The breath and
manure from animals always causes impure air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2203. <em>Oxen.</em>&mdash;Being well-mated, oxen are more easily
trained; and the more easily to effect this, much self-denial on
the part of the driver, much coolness of temper, more training
by motion and less by voice, may be highly advantageous to
man and beast.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2204. <em>To Select.</em>&mdash;Adopt the practice of selecting best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
lambs every year, for stock. In a few years you have first-rate
sheep. The same course will produce the same effects
in every kind of animal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2205. <em>Hogs.</em>&mdash;<em>Food.</em>&mdash;If pumpkins, roots, apples, or any
of them be fed to fattening hogs with corn, the advantage will
be salutary. Most of the food for swine should be cooked.
Swine fatten much faster on fermented, than on unfermented
food. Salt, charcoal, and once in a while sulphur, are excellent
for hogs under all circumstances.</p>

<p><em>Good Medicine.</em>&mdash;When your hogs get sick, you know not
of what, give them ears of corn, first dipped in tar, and then
rolled in sulphur.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2206. <em>Bees.</em>&mdash;(See <a href="#Page_176">p. 176</a>).&mdash;Every farmer should keep
bees; a few swarms to furnish honey for his own use, if no
more. They toil with unremitting industry, asking but a full
sweep of the wing, and no monopoly. Every man, in either
town or country, can keep bees to advantage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2207. <em>Care of Bees in Winter.</em>&mdash;A cold, dry, dark room, is
the best winter-quarters for bees. They will consume less
honey than if left on their summer stands, and will not be weakened
by the loss of thousands, which, tempted out by the premature
warmth, are caught by the cold winds, fall to the
ground, and never rise again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2208. "<em>Never kill a bee.</em>"&mdash;The smoke of the <em>fungus maximus</em>,
or common puff ball, when dried so as to hold fire, has
a stupefying effect on the bees, and renders them as harmless
as brimstone does, without any of its deadly effects.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2209. <em>Mignonette, Sweet.</em>&mdash;Is especially mentioned as easily
cultivated by drills in a garden, and is one of the finest and richest
flowers in the world from which the honey-bee can extract
its food.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2210. <em>Horses.</em>&mdash;See <a href="#Page_199">page 199</a>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2211. <em>To cure Scratches on a Horse.</em>&mdash;Wash the legs with
warm strong soap-suds, and then with beef brine. Two applications
will cure the worst case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2212. <em>Bite of a Spider.</em>&mdash;Catnip bruised and applied to
the wound, is said to be a cure for the bite of a spider.</p>


<hr class="r10" /><a name="X2213" id="X2213"></a>
<p>2213. <em>To preserve a Granary from Insects and Weasels.</em>&mdash;Make
the floor of Lombardy poplars.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2214. <em>To prevent the Creaking of a Door.</em>&mdash;Rub a bit of
soap on the hinges.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2215. <em>Sulphur</em> is valuable in preserving grapes, plants, &amp;c.,
from insects.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2216. <em>Salt</em> is really necessary to horses, cattle, and sheep,
and they should be supplied with it at regular stated intervals
throughout all seasons of the year.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2217. <em>Manure</em>, on a wet soil, produces but half its effect;
and gypsum, that grand stimulant of dry soils, on a wet one
is useless.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2218. <em>Hen-House</em> should be warm in winter, well-ventilated,
white-washed, and kept clean. For the floor, use <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'slacked'">slaked</span>
lime, fine gravel or ashes, or burnt oyster shells. (See <a href="#Page_200">page 200</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2219. <em>A single dozen</em> fowls, properly attended, will furnish
a family with more than 2,000 eggs in a year, and 100 full-grown
chickens for fall and winter stores.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2220. <em>Expense.</em>&mdash;The expense of feeding the dozen fowls
will not amount to 18 bushels of Indian corn. They may be
kept in cities as well as in the country, and will do as well shut
up the year round as to run at large, with proper care.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2221. <em>A Fact.</em>&mdash;Eggs the nearest to roundness produce
females, and those pointed at one end always produce males.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2222. <em>For Fattening.</em>&mdash;<em>Boiled</em> Indian, wheat and barley, is
better than oats, rye, or buckwheat. One-third is gained by
<em>boiling</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2223. <em>Eggs</em>, little boiled or poached, in small quantity, convey
much nourishment; the yolk only should be eaten by invalids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2224. <em>Salt for Poultry.</em>&mdash;Salt is good for water-fowls, but
death to land fowls and birds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2225. <em>Salt for Pigeons.</em>&mdash;Pigeons are fond of salt, and it
keeps them in health. Lay a large heap of clay near the
house, and let the salt-brine that may be done with in the family
be poured upon it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2226. <em>To Fatten Fowls in a short time.</em>&mdash;Mix together
ground rice well scalded with milk, and add some coarse sugar.
Feed them with this in the day-time, but not too much at once;
let it be pretty thick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2227. <em>Pork cured.</em>&mdash;Soon as cool enough to cut, and before
it freezes, pack a clean cask full, with plenty of salt on all
sides of each piece. Fill up with water, taking care, by means
of a large stone, to keep the pork under the pickle, and covered
from flies, in a cellar. Never boil pickle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2228. <em>Pork Feeding.</em>&mdash;It is a well-ascertained fact, that
more meat will be made on half the weight of corn, if ground
and made into mush instead of being fed whole.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2229. <em>In Smoking Hams</em>, &amp;c., be careful not to have the
fire too high, or the smoke-house top tight. It is best done
in an upper story, to which the smoke is conveyed in tubes,
from oak or maple chips in the cellar. (See <a href="#Page_324">p. 324</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2230. <em>Hollow Horn.</em>&mdash;Where supposed to exist, feed half-peck
potatoes twice a week, and treat your cattle kindly in
food and shelter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2231. <em>Sheep</em> must be fed well, kept dry, have salt often,
and pure air, and be grazed in hilly stony pastures.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2232. <em>Cows.</em>&mdash;Those who wish their cows to give large
messes of milk in the winter season, should give them warm
drink. The extra trouble will be more than repaid in the increased
quantity of milk. (See <a href="#Page_285">pp. 285-6</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2233. <em>Wild Onion</em> may be destroyed by cultivating corn,
plowing and leaving the field in its plowed state all winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2234. <em>Remember.</em>&mdash;The great rule in relation to animals
holds perfect in its application to vegetables; breed only from
the best animals; <em>defects and imperfections have always a
tendency to propagate themselves, and are always, in a greater
or less degree, transmitted</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2235. <em>Wheat</em> shoots strongest when there is an interval between
the time of plowing and sowing, but <em>barley</em> is most
vegetative when sown immediately after the plow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2236. <em>Grease Wheels.</em>&mdash;Fifty parts, by weight, of pulverized
black lead, 50 of lard, 50 of soap, and 5 of quicksilver. Rub
the lard and mercury first together, then the lead and soap. If
well mixed, it is invaluable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2237. <em>Plants</em>, when drooping, are revived by a few grains
of camphor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2238. <em>Flowers</em> beginning to fade, can be restored by putting
the stems in scalding water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2239. <em>Bacon Hams in Summer.</em>&mdash;Pack in a barrel, in clean
dry ashes or charcoal; head up the barrel and put it where it
is dry, and as cool as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2240. <em>Timber</em> cut in the spring and exposed to the weather
<em>with the bark on</em>, decays much sooner than that <em>cut in the fall</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2241. <em>In Feeding</em> with corn, 60 lbs. ground goes as far as
100 lbs. in the kernel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2242. <em>Apples.</em>&mdash;Experiments show apples to be equal to
potatoes to improve hogs, and decidedly profitable for fattening
cattle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2243. <em>Pears</em> are greatly improved by grafting on the mountain
ash.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2244. <em>Rats</em> and other vermin are kept away from grain by
a sprinkling of garlic when packing the sheaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2245. <em>Wet Land.</em>&mdash;Money skillfully expended in drying
land, by draining or otherwise, will be returned with ample
interest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2246. <em>Grass.</em>&mdash;Sweet and nutritious grass gives a richness
and flavor to milk, attainable from no other source.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2247. <em>Curing Fodder.</em>&mdash;Bundles may be so placed around
centre-poles as to form a hollow-stack, having a foundation of
brush, sticks, &amp;c., admitting a circulation of air that will thoroughly
cure fodder in the shade.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2248. <em>Turnips</em> of small size have double the nutritious matter
that large ones have.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2249. <em>Ruta Baga</em> is the only root that increases in nutritious
qualities as it increases in size.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2250. <em>In transplanting</em> trees, the hole should not be proportioned
to the extent of the roots <em>as they are</em>, but to their
extent as they <em>may be</em> and <em>should be</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2251. <em>Toads</em> are the very best protection of cabbages against
lice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2252. <em>Peach Trees</em> are protected from hard winters by covering the
roots a foot deep with straw, in <em>January</em>, after the
ground has become thoroughly frozen, which keeps the frost
in the ground, and so prevents the sap from starting until the
Spring is fairly opened.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2253. <em>Save your Fire Wood.</em>&mdash;Mr. Madison, in his Notes
of Agriculture, says, "Of all the errors in our rural economy,
none perhaps is to be so much regretted, because none so difficult
to be repaired, as the excessive and injudicious destruction
of fire-wood."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2254. <em>Sorrel</em> may be killed out by lime, while ashes have no
effect on it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2255. <em>Shumac</em> or <em>Sumac</em>, a poisonous shrub or plant, which
grows wild in abundance, and frequently where nothing else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
will, is used for dyeing in England, at the rate of thirteen
thousand tons per annum. It might be made a source of
profit to our farmers.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>GARDENING<br />
(<span class="pfs70">SEE PAGE</span> <a href="#Page_291">291</a>.)</h4>

<p>2256. <em>Kitchen Garden.</em>&mdash;This is one of the most important
parts of general domestic economy, whenever the situation of
a house will permit a family to avail themselves of its assistance,
in aid of butcher's bills.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2257. It is, indeed, much to be regretted that small plots
of ground, in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis more
especially, are too often frittered away into shrubberies and
baby gardens, when they might more usefully be employed in
raising vegetables for the family, during the week-day residence
in town, than wasting their sweetness on the smoky air
in all the pride of lilac, hollyhock, and bachelors' buttons, to
be merely smelled to, by the whole immigrating household on
the day of rest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2258. With a little care and attention, a kitchen-garden,
though small, might be rendered not only useful, but in fact,
as ornamental as a modern grass carpet; and the same
expense incurred to make the ground a labyrinth of sweets,
might suffice to render it agreeable to the palate, as well as to
the olfactory nerves, and that even without offending the most
delicate optics.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2259. It is only in accordance with our plan to give the
hint, and to record such novel points as may facilitate the
proposed arrangement.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2260. It is one objection to the adoption of a kitchen garden
in front of the dwelling, or in sight of the family apartments,
that its very nature makes it rather an eye-sore than
otherwise at all seasons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2261. This, however, is an objection that may be readily
got over by a little attention to neatness and good order,
whilst the plants themselves, if judiciously attended to, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
the borders sown or planted with ranunculus, polyanthus, mignionette,
&amp;c., in succession, will really be ornamental.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2262. But then, in cutting the plants for use, the business
must be done neatly, all useless leaves cleared from the ground,
the roots no longer wanted taken up, and the ravages of insects
to be guarded against by sedulous extirpation. It will
also be found a great improvement, where space will admit of
it, to surround the beds with neat espaliers, with fruit trees,
or even gooseberry and currant bushes trained along them,
instead of these being suffered to grow in a state of ragged
wildness.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DRYING HERBS.</h4>

<p>2263. Fresh herbs are preferable to dried ones, but as they
cannot always be obtained, it is most important to dry herbs
at the proper seasons:&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2264. <em>Basil</em> is in a fit state for drying about the middle of
August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2265. <em>Burret</em> in June, July, and August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2266. <em>Chervil</em> in May, June, and July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2267. <em>Elder Flowers</em> in May, June, and July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2268. <em>Fennel</em> in May, June, and July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2269. <em>Knotted Marjoram</em> during July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2270. <em>Lemon Thyme</em> end of July, and through August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2271. <em>Mint</em> end of June and July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2272. <em>Orange Flowers</em> May, June, and July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2273. <em>Orange Thyme</em> (a delicious herb), June and July.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2274. <em>Parsley</em> May, June, and July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2275. <em>Sage</em>, August and September.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2276. <em>Summer Savory</em>, end of July and August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2277. <em>Tarragon</em>, June, July, and August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2278. <em>Thyme</em>, end of July and August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2279. <em>Winter Savory</em>, end of July and August.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2280. These herbs always at hand will be a great aid to the
cook.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2281. Herbs should be gathered on a dry day; they should
be immediately well cleansed, and dried by the heat of a stove,
or Dutch oven.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2282. The leaves should then be picked off, pounded and
sifted, and put away for use.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>PROPERTIES AND USES OF VEGETABLES.</h4>

<p>2283. <em>Parsley</em> is very cooling and softening.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2284. <em>Catnip</em> is a warm herb, of a diaphoretic or sweating
nature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2285. <em>Pennyroyal</em> is much the same, only more powerful.
It retains a very powerful pungent oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2286. <em>Spearmint</em> is pungent and hot, but of an astringent
nature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2287. <em>Calamint</em> is much the same, but not so strong.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2288. <em>Hoarhound</em> is very strengthening to the lungs, and
is somewhat of a pectoral. It is excellent in a cough, or stopage
in the stomach.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2289. <em>Everlasting</em>, or <em>Indian Posey</em>, is a very balsamic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
herb&mdash;healing and cooling, and excellent in salves or ointment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2290. <em>Johnswort</em> is much the same.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2291. <em>Pea Balm</em> is a cooling and sweating herb, and is
good in fevers and inflammations.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2292. <em>Chamomile</em> is a great restorative to the lungs, and
promotes perspiration. It is good in salves and ointments to
take away swellings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2293. <em>Mayweed</em> is of a pectoral nature, and is good for a
pain in the side.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2294. <em>Garden Coltsfoot</em> is a great restorative to the lungs,
and is good in syrups for coughs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2295. <em>Melilot</em> is good in salves and ointments for swellings
and inflammations. It is mollifying and cooling.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2296. <em>Sage</em> is the greatest restorative to human nature of
any herb that grows.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2297. <em>Bloodroot</em> is a very powerful emetic or purge: steeped
in spirits, it will serve for an emetic; and boiled in fair water
it serves as a purge.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2298. <em>Mandrake</em> root is an excellent physic, dried and
pounded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2299. <em>Cumfrey</em> and <em>Spikenard</em> are so well known that they
need no describing.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2300. <em>Elecampane</em> is good in coughs, yet it is an astringent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2301. <em>Cranesbill</em> is an astringent, and excellent in cankers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2302. <em>Whiteroot</em> is of a physical nature, and is good to
remove wind pent in the stomach, or part of the bowels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2303. <em>Sassafras</em> root is good for the blood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2304. So also are <em>Sarsaparilla, Horse Radish, Burdock
roots, Elder roots</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2305. <em>Hop roots</em>, and <em>Wild Coltsfoot</em> are good as pectorals.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2306. <em>White</em> and <em>Yellow Pond Lily roots</em>, the same.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2307. <em>Winter's Bark.</em>&mdash;This is the product of one of
<span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'the the largest'">the largest</span> trees on Terra del Fuego. It is good in dropsy
and scurvy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2308. <em>Wild Jenton</em> is a strong cathartic, when boiled.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>VEGETABLES TO CULTIVATE.</h4>

<p>2327. <em>Endive.</em>&mdash;Sow last of Spring to middle of Summer,
in shallow drills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2328. <em>Egg-Plant.</em>&mdash;Sow in hot-beds early in the Spring;
transplant in rich warm ground late in the Spring, about 30
inches apart. Egg-plant seed will not vegetate freely without
a substantial heat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2329. <em>Lettuce</em> should be sown in seed bed, in the middle of
September; protect the plants through the Winter, and early
in the Spring transplant in rich ground; or sow in hot-beds,
in March, and at intervals throughout the season.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2330. <em>Melon.</em>&mdash;Plant in hills, in light sandy earth, about
the first week in May.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2331. <em>Mushroom Spawn</em> should be planted in hot-beds of
dung, covered with earth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2332. <em>Mustard.</em>&mdash;Sown like Cress, and used for a salad.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2333. <em>Nasturtium.</em>&mdash;Sow in May. The flowers and young
leaves are used as a salad; the seed-pods, with foot-stalk,
are gathered whilst green, and pickled as a substitute for capers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2334. <em>Okra</em>, or <em>Gombo</em>, is one of the best of vegetables.
Plant in May. The seed should be sown thick, as it is liable
to rot in the ground. Very rich ground is required.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2335. <em>Onions</em> should be sown in drills, early in the Spring,
in rich ground, thin, to stand two or three inches apart.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2336. <em>Parsley</em> should be sown early in the Spring. Soak

<p>2337. <em>Parsnip.</em>&mdash;Sow in drills 18 inches apart, in good and
deep-dug ground, early in the Spring.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2338. <em>Peas.</em>&mdash;The best soil for Peas is a light loam. The
early sorts require rich ground. Sow in drills as early in the
Spring as the ground will work.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2339. <em>Pepper.</em>&mdash;Sow late in Spring, in drills, on a warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
border; or in a frame or hot-bed, in March; set out plants
eighteen inches apart.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2340. <em>Pumpkin.</em>&mdash;The Mammoth Pumpkin has been grown
to the enormous weight of 225 pounds. Plant early in May,
in rich soil, in hills, eight to ten feet apart each way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2341. <em>Radish.</em>&mdash;The early kinds should be sown as soon as
the ground can be worked, in a sheltered situation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2342. <em>Rhubarb</em> should be sown in Autumn or early in the
Spring; when in the latter, transplant in the ensuing Spring
to desired situation. The stems are used for tarts, and are fit
for use before green fruit can be obtained, being a very desirable
substitute.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2343. <em>Salsify</em>, or <em>Vegetable Oyster</em>, should be sown during
April. The roots boiled, made into cakes with paste, and
fried like oysters, much resembles them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2344. <em>Spinach</em> should be sown as soon as the ground can
be worked. The soil cannot be too rich for Spinach.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2345. <em>Squash.</em>&mdash;Cultivate same as Cucumber.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2346. <em>Tomato.</em>&mdash;Sow in hills three feet apart, on a warm border,
early in the Spring. As the plants advance in growth,
give them support.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2347. <em>Turnip.</em>&mdash;For summer use, sow early in the Spring.
For main crop, sow close of Summer. The Ruta Baga requires
more time to mature, and should be sown at midsummer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2348. <em>Aromatic and Sweet Herbs.</em>&mdash;Anise, Brazil, (sweet),
Caraway, Coriander, *Fennel, *Lavender, Marygold, Pot,
Marjorum, (sweet), *Sage, Summer Savory, *Winter Savory,
*Thyme, *Mint, *Rosemary, Dill.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2349. Those marked with a * are perennial, and when once
obtained, may be preserved for years. The others are annual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>FRUIT TREES AND FRUIT.</h4>

<p>2350. <em>Fruits</em>, in a ripe and perfect state, are beneficial to
health, if not eaten to excess.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2351. <em>Stunted</em> trees never become vigorous, nor when too
long crowded in nurseries.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2352. In <em>Grafting</em>, 25 well placed are better than 100 grafts
placed at random, and ten placed injudiciously will change the
whole top of a tree in a few years, when 200 grafts may be so
scattered as not materially to change the top of the tree or its
fruit. Graft only on such as are sound and vigorous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2353. <em>Haggling</em> off limbs and branches and leaving stumps
on the trees, which rot off and let the water into the trunk,
soon destroys the tree; therefore, always cut or saw off smooth,
when the wound will heal and the bark grow over.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2354. <em>Sound</em>, vigorous trees, and no other, should be set
out, as they take no more trouble or space than the worthless
ones.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2355. <em>Budding</em> should only be done with fresh buds, on
very small stocks of vigorous growth. Begin after sap starts,
until 1st June. Later will do. Make incision like a T;
raise the corners and insert the bud with as little of the wood
as possible, and bandage, not too tight, for three weeks.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2356. <em>Scions</em> may be cut in February or March, before or
at the time the buds begin to swell; or take grafts size of a
pipe-stem, from bearing branches, not from side shoots nor
the rank growth of the top. Put in earth one-third their
length, keep from frost, and occasionally sprinkle, to prevent
shriveling, but not so wet as to sprout them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2357. <em>Composition.</em>&mdash;Resin 8 oz., beeswax, 3 oz.; melt up
with lard, and work it like shoemaker's wax; for wounds made
in pruning or grafting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2358. <em>Split</em> the stock, drive in a wedge six or eight inches long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
open the split so as to admit the graft freely; sharpen end of
graft and insert, matching the wood of graft and wood of the
stock; remove the wedge carefully, and cover smooth over
with composition, tight, to exclude air, and the sap will force
its way to the graft.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2359. <em>Seed.</em>&mdash;Select from healthy trees, sound, ripe and fair
fruit, and place in sand, in a cellar or other cool, damp place,
until time to plant. If kept too dry, they seldom vegetate.
Let the soil be good, well worked, not too wet; cover up and
press the ground moderately over. Plant in Fall, before the
ground is frozen, or in Spring, soon as the ground can be
worked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2360. <em>Soil.</em>&mdash;Low, wet or marshy ground is not suitable.
Soil appropriate for crops of grain, is also adapted to the cultivation
of fruit trees, shrubs or vines. Occasional digging,
mellowing the ground, keeping down underbrush and weeds,
and manuring, are beneficial.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2361. <em>Cleanliness</em> is essential. Destroy all caterpillars,
noxious worms and insects, and prune off all affected parts.
Scrape off all rough, ragged bark and moss, and wash well
with soap-suds or cover with a coat of limewash. Remove
all suckers from the roots, side branches and excrescences.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2362. <em>Grubs</em>, which occasion disease, may be prevented by
coating the roots and lower trunk, about July 1, with tar,
train oil, or whitewash, and sprinkling a little lime, ashes, or
soap-suds, on the ground around the tree. When seriously
affected, dig the earth from the roots near the surface, and
search thoroughly in the bark for the grub; cleanse off the
gum, &amp;c., wash with ley or soap-suds, or rub dry ashes over
them, and close up with good fresh earth. Doing this as occasion
requires, will ensure health and vigor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2363. <em>Slugs and Snails</em> are great enemies to every kind of
garden-plant, whether flower or vegetable; they wander in the
night to feed, and return at daylight to their haunts; the
shortest and surest direction is, "Rise early, catch them, and
kill them."&mdash;(See <a href="#Page_281">p. 281</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2364. <em>Another way.</em>&mdash;Lay cabbage leaves about the ground,
especially on the beds which they frequent. Every morning
examine these leaves, and you will find a great many taking
refuge beneath.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2365. <em>Caterpillars and Aphides.</em>&mdash;A garden syringe or
engine, with a cap on the pipe full of very minute holes, will
wash away these disagreeable visitors very quickly. You
must bring the pipe close to the plant, and pump hard, so as
to have considerable force on, and the plant, however badly
infested, will soon be cleared without receiving any injury.&mdash;(See
<a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2366. <em>Rake the Earth.</em>&mdash;Every time that you use the
syringe or garden-engine, you must immediately rake the earth
under the trees, and kill the insects you have dislodged, or
many will recover and climb up the stems of the plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2367. <em>Grubs on Orchard Trees.</em>&mdash;Make a bonfire with dry
sticks and weeds on the windward side of the orchard, so that
the smoke may blow among the trees; you will destroy thousands;
for the grubs have such an objection to smoke, that
very little of it makes them roll themselves up and fall off;
they must be swept up afterward.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2368. <em>Wasps</em> destroy a good deal of fruit, but every pair
of wasps killed in spring saves the trouble and annoyance of
a swarm in autumn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2369. <em>Butterflies and Moths</em>, however pretty, are the worst
enemies one can have in a garden; a single insect of this kind
may deposit eggs enough to overrun a tree with caterpillars,
therefore they should be destroyed at any cost of trouble.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2370. The only moth that you must spare, is the common
black and red one; the grubs of this feed exclusively on grounsel,
and are therefore a valuable ally of the gardener.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2371. <em>Earwigs</em> are very destructive insects; their favorite
food is the petals of roses, pinks, dahlias, and other flowers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2372. <em>To kill Earwigs.</em>&mdash;They may be caught by driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
stakes into the ground, and placing on each an inverted flower-pot;
the earwigs will climb up and take refuge under it, when
they may be taken out and killed.&mdash;(See <a href="#Page_279">p. 279</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2373. Or very deep holes may be made in the ground with a
crowbar, into these they will fall, and may be destroyed by
boiling water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2374. <em>Toads</em> are among the best friends the gardener has;
for they live almost exclusively on the most destructive kinds
of vermin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2375. <em>The Rose Slug.</em>&mdash;A new and sure mode to destroy
these insects, either when as a fly laying its eggs, or as a slug,
is the following:&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2376. <em>Whale Oil Soap</em>, dissolved at the rate of two pounds
to fifteen gallons of water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2377. <em>Mode of Preparation.</em>&mdash;Take whatever quantity of
soap you wish to prepare, and dissolve it in boiling water,
about one quart to a pound; in this way strain it through a
fine wire or hair sieve, which takes out the dirt, prevents its
stopping the valves of the engine, or the nose of the syringe;
then add cold water to make it the proper strength.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2378. <em>How to use it.</em>&mdash;Apply it to the rose-bush with a hand
engine or syringe, with as much force as practicable, and be
sure that every part of the leaves is well saturated with the
liquid. What falls to the ground in application, will do good
in destroying the worms and enriching the soil, and from its
trifling cost, it can be used with profusion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2379. <em>The cost.</em>&mdash;A hogshead of 136 gallons costs forty-five
cents&mdash;not quite four mills per gallon. Early in the morning,
or in the evening, is the proper time to apply it to the
plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2380. <em>Mildew</em> on the Gooseberry, Peach, Grape-vine, &amp;c.,
is checked and entirely destroyed by a weak dressing of the
solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2381. <em>The Canker Worm.</em>&mdash;Laying soap oil on the trunk
and branches of the tree, at the consistency of thick paint, destroys
the brown, scaly insect on the bark, and gives the
tree a smooth, glossy, and healthy appearance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2382. <em>To free Plants from Leaf-Lice.</em>&mdash;Mix one ounce of
flowers of sulphur with one bushel of sawdust; scatter this
over the plants infected with these insects, and they will soon
be freed, though a second application may possibly be necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2383. <em>Keeping Fruits.</em>&mdash;The three best of eight different
modes fairly tried, are, 1, covering in pure dry sand; 2, in dry
fern; 3, in a deal box buried in the earth. In all cases to be
kept cool.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2384. <em>Sunflower</em> yields 140 bushels per acre, and each
bushel one gallon of good oil. Its leaves furnish provender;
its seeds, food for poultry and hogs. It thrives on poor soils.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2385. <em>To prepare a cheap Hortus Siccus.</em>&mdash;All the small
plants should be expanded under water, in a plate, on a piece
of writing-paper. In this state they will assume their natural
form and position. Then withdraw the paper with the plant
gently from the water, and place them between sheets of blotting-paper,
and press them with a book or flat board. When
dry, it may be placed on writing-paper.</p>

<h3>PERSONAL MATTERS.</h3>

<p class="hsumm"><em>Dress of Ladies&mdash;Dress of Gentlemen&mdash;Manners&mdash;Etiquette
of Society&mdash;Dinner Parties&mdash;Courtship&mdash;Marriage&mdash;The
Ceremony&mdash;After Marriage&mdash;Social Intercourse&mdash;"Our
House," etc.</em></p>


<p>2386. <em>Importance of Dress.</em>&mdash;Attention to personal appearance
is a human duty as well as a required observance in civilized
society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2387. The following rules will be found useful in guiding
the judgment and taste of those who desire to dress well.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DRESS OF LADIES.</h4>

<p>2388. A young lady should always be neatly attired. A
fresh-looking and well-fitting dress is more important than
rich materials or showy ornaments.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2389. Never furbish up old finery, if you wish to appear
really the lady. A clean, soft, white muslin gown is far more
genteel than a tarnished brocade.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2390. <em>Colors and Complexions.</em>&mdash;The great art, as regards
colors of dress, is to enhance the tints of the complexion, care
being taken to let the flesh appear of a healthy natural hue,
and to avoid wearing those colors which heighten or destroy
either the red, yellow, or white, in the natural flesh tints.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2391. <em>Primitive Colors.</em>&mdash;Out of three primitive colors,
red, blue, and yellow, there are endless mixtures and variations,
and some of these can skillfully be adapted to any complexion;
but to do so, these two rules must be observed: the
rule of Harmony and of judicious Contrast.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2392. <em>Decided Colors</em>, or colors without mixture, are very
unbecoming. A lady all <em>blue</em> in dress would be more disagreeable
than a real <em>bleu</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2393. <em>Red</em>, and its dark variations, may be worn by dark
persons, and will harmonize with their complexion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2394. <em>Crimson and <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'brillliant'">brilliant</span> red</em> are vulgar and unsuitable,
but purple and dark maroon, worn by brunettes, and persons
of a dark complexion, are both becoming and genteel, either
in evening or winter dresses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2395. <em>Blue</em> is a becoming color to fair faces and blue eyes.
It also looks well worn by brunettes, when the wearer is
youthful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2396. <em>Light blue</em> is a beautiful color for spring dresses;
dark blues look better in the autumn and winter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2397. <em>Red Colors.</em>&mdash;<em>Light red and pink</em>, approaching flesh
tints, are becoming both to dark and to fair; to the former
especially, because they, by contrast, set off the complexion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2398. Fair persons venturing upon such dresses or trimmings
by daylight, should have clear and excellent complexions,
or the brightness of the color, from a similarity of tint, will
make their faces appear dirty and clouded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2399. <em>Chocolate colors</em>, and warm browns partaking of red,
may be worn by either fair or dark persons, provided they be
not too pale, in which case the contrast will render the face
chalky or death-like.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2400. <em>Yellow</em> in dress, as well as orange, is also more becoming
to dark than to fair persons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2401. <em>Primrose</em> is becoming to fair persons. The trimmings
of this color, the flowers and ribbons, should be violet,
such contrast being agreeable to art and nature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2402. <em>Maize</em> color is becoming to all complexions, especially
to those which are brilliant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2403. <em>Grain</em> is more becoming to fair than to dark persons,
because in the fair complexion, brilliancy and depth of
color are more frequently found.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2404. <em>Pale green</em> should never be worn by the dark, it rendering
them sickly and cadaverous in look. To those of a fair
and brilliant complexion it is most becoming.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2405. <em>Trimmings.</em>&mdash;For trimmings and flowers ladies cannot
do better than to study nature, there being in the leaves
of flowers every imaginable tint of green, whilst the flowers
themselves are various in their hue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2406. <em>Artificials</em> should be few, and perfectly arranged. A
load of flowers is a burden, not a beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2407. The most elegant dresses are black or white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2408. A vulgar girl wears bright and glaring colors, fantastically
made, a large flaring, red, yellow, or sky-blue hat,
covered with a rainbow of ribbons, and all the rings and trinkets
she can load upon her.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2409. In any assemblage, the most plainly-dressed woman
is sure to be the most lady-like and attractive. Neatness is
better than richness, and plainness better than display.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2410. It is a general rule, applicable to both sexes, that
persons are the best dressed when you cannot remember how
they were dressed. Avoid every thing out of the way, uncommon,
or grotesque.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2411. Single ladies dress less in fashionable society than
married ones; and all more plainly and substantially for walking
or traveling, than on other occasions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2412. Common modesty should prevent indecent exposure
of the shoulders and bosom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2413. <em>Tight Lacing.</em>&mdash;No woman who laces tight can have
good shoulders, a straight spine, good lungs, sweet breath, or
is fit to be a wife and mother.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2414. Can it be a pleasant sight to behold a woman cut in
two in the middle, as it were, like a wasp? On the contrary,
it is as shocking to the eye as it is painful to the imagination.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2415. Every thing that confines and lays nature under a
restraint is an instance of bad taste. This is as true in regard
to the ornaments of the body as to the embellishments of the
mind.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2416. Life, health, reason, and convenience, ought to be
taken first into consideration.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2417. Gracefulness cannot subsist without ease; delicacy is
not debility; nor must a woman be sick in order to please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2418. The distinction of the sexes, notwithstanding that it
is so prominent and marked, still requires a distinctive dress.
This has generally, by all nations, civilized or savage, been
conceded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2419. This difference has been so permanent, that any attempt
to lessen it&mdash;and there have been many&mdash;has failed,
and must fail whenever attempted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2420. <em>Robes.</em>&mdash;The outer garment of woman is, and has
been for centuries, the robe or gown, and upon the proper
choice, make, and disposition of this, and its concomitants,
depends the elegance or inelegance of the wearer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2421. The gown should fall gracefully from the hips, as free
as possible from the odious "bustle" or "hoop." It should
fall in long full folds, and expand gradually to the feet, which
it should touch, but not entirely cover.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2422. <em>Flounces</em> should only be worn by those of a tall,
graceful figure, and then they should be made of a light material,
gauze, muslin, or of stuff akin to it, so that they fall in
gracefully with the outline of the dress. When made of any
rich stuff, which stands out stiffly, they break the graceful flow
of the dress.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2423. Flounces, by marking the height, at regular intervals,
take away from it, and make a short figure look shorter. For
this reason, short persons should not wear stripes running in
parallel rings round the dress. Perpendicular stripes upon a
dress make the wearer look taller, like the flutes in a composite.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2424. The rules which we have given for the color of the
dress, must of course apply to the covering for the head; the
colors must, to look well, contrast or harmonize with the complexion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2425. Texture, material, and pattern, should suit, not only
the taste, but also the purse. There are few greater evils in
this country than an inordinate passion for dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2426. No one looks so well dressed as those who are
dressed properly, neatly, and whose attire sets them at their
ease. A lady who is so over-dressed as to be constantly
afraid of spoiling her gown, can never be graceful, since she
cannot be at her ease.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2427. <em>The hair</em> should always be neatly brushed and arranged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2428. <em>Ringlets</em> make round faces look longer, and more
oval; plain bands make the face which is too long, lose part
of that length. This should be studied. It is manifestly absurd
to render oneself hideous merely to follow the fashion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2429. The dress of the foot is important both for beauty
and health.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2430. Thus, a thin shoe in winter would be vulgar, because
useless and dangerous to the wearer's health, and a thick boot
in summer would be <em>gauche</em> and vulgar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2431. <em>Boots and shoes</em> should be well, nay, scientifically
made. The foot should be fitted well, but not compressed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2432. Modern boots and shoes are therefore often made
narrow, just where they should be wide; and the foot, instead
of being beautiful in shape, and graceful in its action, becomes
long, narrow, distorted, and ungraceful when used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2433. <em>Gloves</em> must be fresh and well-fitting to make the
dress perfect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2434. Ladies' dresses should be chosen so as to produce an
agreeable harmony.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2435. Never put on a dark-colored bonnet with a light
spring costume.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2436. Avoid uniting colors which will suggest an epigram;
such as a straw-colored dress with a green bonnet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2437. The arrangement of the hair is most important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2438. Bands are becoming to faces of a Grecian caste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2439. Ringlets better suit lively and expressive heads.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2440. Whatever be your style of face, avoid an excess of
lace, and let flowers be few and choice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2441. In a married woman, a richer style of ornament is
admissible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2442. Costly elegance for the married&mdash;for the young girl,
a style of modest simplicity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2443. The most elegant dress loses its character if it is not
worn with grace.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2444. Young girls have often an air of constraint, and their
dress seems to partake of their want of ease.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2445. In speaking of her toilet, a woman should not convey
the idea that her whole skill consists in adjusting tastefully
some trifling ornaments.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2446. A simple style of dress is an indication of modesty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2447. <em>Neatness.</em>&mdash;The hands should receive special attention.
They are the outward signs of general cleanliness. The
same may be said of the face, the neck, the ears, and the
teeth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2448. The cleanliness of the system generally, and of bodily
apparel, pertains to Health, and will be treated of under this
head.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2449. <em>The Handkerchief.</em>&mdash;There is considerable art in
using this accessory of dress and comfort.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2450. Avoid extreme patterns, styles, and colors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2451. Never be without a handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2452. Hold it freely in the hand, and do not roll it into a
ball. Hold it by the centre, and let the corners form a fan-like
expansion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2453. Avoid using it too much. With some persons the
habit becomes troublesome and unpleasant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2454. <em>A word to Young Ladies.</em>&mdash;If you have blue eyes, you
need not languish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2455. If black eyes, you need not stare.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2456. If you have pretty feet, there is no occasion to wear
short petticoats.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2457. If you are doubtful as to that point, there can be no
harm in letting them be long.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2458. If you have good teeth, do not laugh for the purpose
of showing them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2459. If you have bad ones, do not laugh less than the occasion
may justify.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2460. If you have pretty hands and arms, there can be no
objection to your playing on the harp, if you play well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2461. If they are disposed to be clumsy, work tapestry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2462. If you have a bad voice, speak in a rather low tone.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2463. If you have the finest voice in the world, never speak
in a high tone.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2464. If you dance well, dance but seldom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2465. If you dance ill, never dance at all.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2466. If you sing well, make no previous excuses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2467. If you sing indifferently, hesitate not a moment when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
you are asked, for few people are judges of singing, but every
one is sensible of a desire to please.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2468. If you would preserve beauty, rise early.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2469. If you would preserve esteem, be gentle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2470. If you would obtain power, be condescending.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2471. If you would live happy, endeavor to promote the
happiness of others.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DRESS OF A GENTLEMAN.</h4>

<p>2472. Since dress is, with the world, the outward sign of
both character and condition: and since it costs no more to
dress well than ill, and is not very troublesome, every one
should endeavor to do the best that his circumstances will
allow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2473. <em>The Shirt.</em>&mdash;A clean, unrumpled shirt, coarse or
fine, cotton or linen, as you can afford, is of the first importance.
If the choice is between a fine shirt or a fine coat, have
the shirt by all means.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2474. <em>Fine Linen</em>, and a good hat, gloves and boots are
evidences of the highest taste in dress.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2475. A gentleman walking should always wear gloves, this
being one of the characteristics of good breeding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2476. Upon public and State occasions, officers should appear
in uniform.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2478. A black coat and trowsers are indispensable for a
visit of ceremony, an entertainment, or a ball.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2479. The white or black waistcoat is equally proper in
these cases.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2480. Yellow or white gloves are worn in the ball-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2481. A neat exterior, equally free from extravagance and
poverty, almost always proclaims a right-minded man.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2482. To dress appropriately, and with good taste, is to
respect yourself and others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2483. <em>Neatness.</em>&mdash;A well-bred man may be ever so reduced
in his wardrobe&mdash;his clothes may be coarse and threadbare,
but he seldom wears a coarse, and never a dirty shirt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2484. <em>The Boots.</em>&mdash;Boots are now men's common wear on
all occasions, varying in elegance for different purposes. They
should always be clean, and invariably well blackened and
polished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2485. <em>The Hat.</em>&mdash;Make a point of buying a good hat. One
proper fur hat, worth four or five dollars, when a year old, looks
more respectable than a silk one bought yesterday.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2486. Of the trowsers little need be said. When full at the
bottom they serve to hide a large foot. If colored trowsers
are worn, those patterns should be chosen which conform to the
rules of taste. Bars running across the legs should be avoided,
and also all large staring patterns.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2487. <em>The Vest</em> allows of some fancy, but beware of being
too fanciful. A black satin is proper for any person or any
occasion. Nothing is more elegant than pure white. Some
quiet colors may be worn for variety, but beware of every
thing staring or glaring, in materials or trimmings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2488. Avoid all singularity in dress; never wear gaudy
waistcoats, out-of-the-way hats, or coats of the extreme of
"sporting fashion:" such things are positively odious.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2489. We may add a few general maxims, applied to both
sexes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2490. "All affectation in dress," says Chesterfield, "implies
a flaw in the understanding." One should therefore avoid
being singular, or eccentric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2491. Never dress against any one. Choose those garments
which suit you, and look well upon you, perfectly irrespective
of the fact that a lady or gentleman in the same village or
street may excel you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2492. When dressed for company, strive to appear as easy
and natural as if you were in undress.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2493. Dress according to your age. It is both painful and
ridiculous to see an old lady dressed as a belle of four-and-twenty;
or an old fellow, old enough for a grandfather, affecting
the costume and the manners of a <em>beau</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2494. Young men should be <em>well</em> dressed. Not foppishly,
but neatly and well. An untidy person at five-and-twenty,
degenerates, very frequently, into a sloven and a boor at
fifty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2495. Be not too negligent, nor too studied, in your attire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2496. Let your behavior and conversation suit the clothes
you wear, so that those who know you may feel that, after all,
dress and external appearance is the least portion of a <span class="smcap">lady
or gentleman</span>.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>MANNERS.</h4>

<p>2497. It is sometimes objected to books upon etiquette,
that they cause those who consult them to act with mechanical
restraint, and to show in society that they are governed by
arbitrary rules, rather than by an intuitive perception of what
is graceful and polite.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2498. This objection is unsound, because it supposes that
people who study the theory of etiquette, do not also exercise
their powers of observation in society, and obtain, by their intercourse
with others, that freedom and ease of deportment,
which society alone can impart.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2499. Books upon etiquette are useful, inasmuch as that
they expound the laws of polite society. Experience alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
however, can give effect to the precise <em>manner</em> in which those
laws are required to be observed.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2500. Whatever objections may be raised to the teachings
of works upon etiquette, there can be no sound argument
against a series of simple and brief hints, which shall operate
as precautions against mistakes in personal conduct.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2501. Avoid intermeddling with the affairs of others. This
is a most common fault.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2502. A number of people seldom meet but they begin discussing
the affairs of some one who is absent. This is not only
uncharitable but positively unjust. It is equivalent to trying
a <em>cause in the absence of the person implicated</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2503. Even in the criminal code, a prisoner is presumed to
be innocent until he is found guilty. Society, however, is less
just, and passes judgment without hearing the defense.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2504. Depend upon it, as a certain rule, <em>that the people who
unite with you in discussing the affairs of others, will proceed
to scandalize you the moment that you depart</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2505. Be consistent in the avowal of principles. Do not
deny to-day, that which you asserted yesterday. You may
fancy that you gain favor by subserviency; but so far from
gaining favor, you lose respect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2506. Avoid falsehood. There can be found no higher
virtue than that of truth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2507. Be honest. Not only because "honesty is the best
policy," but because it is a duty to God and to man.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2508. Avoid idleness&mdash;it is the parent of many evils. Can
you pray, "Give us this day our daily bread," and not hear
the reply, "Do thou this day thy daily duty?"</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2509. Avoid telling idle tales, which is like firing arrows in
the dark; you know not into whose heart they may fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2510. Avoid talking about yourself; praising your own
works; and proclaiming your own deeds. If they are good,
they will proclaim themselves; if bad, the less you say of
them the better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2511. Be kind in little things.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2512. The true generosity of the heart is more displayed by
deeds of minor kindness, than by acts which may partake of
ostentation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2513. Reason is given for man's guidance. Passion is the
tempest by which reason is overthrown. Under the effects of
passion, man's mind becomes disordered, his face disfigured,
his body deformed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2514. A moment's passion has frequently cut off a life's
friendship, destroyed a life's hope, imbittered a life's peace,
and brought unending sorrow and disgrace.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2515. Avoid pride. If you are handsome, God made you
so; if you are learned, some one instructed you; if you are
rich, God gave you what you own.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2516. The best men throughout all history, have been the
most humble.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2517. Affectation is a form of pride. It is, in fact, pride
made ridiculous and contemptible. Affectation is usually the
fault of weak people.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2518. Avoid swearing. An oath is but the wrath of a
perturbed spirit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2519. It is <em>mean</em>. A man of high moral standing would
rather treat an offense with contempt, than show his indignation
by an oath.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2520. It is <em>vulgar</em>: altogether too low for a decent man.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2521. It is <em>cowardly</em>: implying a fear <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'of either of not'">of either not</span> being
believed or obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2522. It is <em>ungentlemanly</em>. A gentleman, according to
Webster, is a <em>genteel man</em>&mdash;well-bred, refined.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2523. It is <em>indecent</em>: offensive to delicacy, and extremely
unfit for human ears.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2524. It is <em>foolish</em>. "Want of decency is want of sense."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2525. It is <em>abusive</em>&mdash;to the mind which conceives the oath,
to the tongue which utters it, and to the person at whom it
is aimed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2526. It is <em>venomous</em>, showing a man's heart to be as a
nest of vipers; and every time he swears, one of them starts
out from his head.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2527. It is <em>contemptible</em>&mdash;forfeiting the respect of all the
wise and good.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2528. It is <em>wicked</em>: violating the Divine law, and provoking
the displeasure of Him who will not hold him guiltless who
takes his name in vain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2529. Be a gentleman. Swear not at all.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2530. Moderation, decorum, and neatness, distinguish the
gentleman; he is at all times affable, diffident, and studious
to please. Intelligent and polite, his behavior is pleasant
and graceful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2531. Appear only to be a gentleman, and its shadow will
bring upon you contempt; be a gentleman, and its honors will
remain even after you are dead.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2532. The foregoing remarks may be said to apply to the
moral conduct, rather than to the details of personal manners.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2533. Great principles, however, suggest minor ones; and
hence from the principles laid down, many hints upon personal
behavior may be gathered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2534. Be hearty in your salutations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2535. Be true in your professions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2536. Discreet and sincere in your friendships.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2537. Like to listen rather than to talk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2538. Behave, even in the presence of your relations, as
though you felt respect to be due to them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2539. In society never forget that you are but one of many.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2540. Visiting a friend, conform to the rules of his home.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2541. Lean not upon his tables, nor rub your feet against
his chairs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2542. Pry not into letters that are not your own.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2543. Pay unmistakable respect to ladies everywhere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2544. Beware of foppery and of silly flirtation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2545. In public places, be not pertinacious of your rights.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2546. Find pleasure in making concessions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2547. Speak distinctly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2548. Look at the person to whom you speak.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2549. When you have spoken, give him an opportunity to
reply.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2550. Avoid drunkenness as you would a curse; and modify
all appetites, especially those that are acquired.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2551. Dress well, but not superfluously.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2552. Be neither like a sloven, nor like a stuffed model.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2553. Keep away all uncleanly appearances from the person.
Let the nails, the teeth, and in fact, the whole system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
receive <em>salutary</em> rather than <em>studied</em> care. But let these things
receive attention at the toilet&mdash;not elsewhere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2554. Avoid displaying excess of jewelry. Nothing looks
more effeminate upon a man.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2555. Every one of these suggestions may be regarded as
the centre of many others, which the earnest mind can not
fail to discover.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2556. Avoid envy, for it can not benefit you, nor can it
injure those against whom it is cherished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2557. Avoid disputation, for the mere sake of argument.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2558. Be sociable; avoid reserve in society.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2559. Remember that the social elements, like the air we
breathe, are purified by motion. Thought illumines thought,
and smiles win smiles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2560. Be punctual. One minute too late has lost many a
golden opportunity. Besides which, the want of punctuality
is an affront offered to the person to whom your presence is
due.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2561. Be polite. Politeness is the poetry of conduct&mdash;and
like poetry it has many qualities.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2562. Let not your politeness be too florid, but of that
gentle kind which indicates refined nature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2563. It is true, indeed, that we should not dissemble and
flatter in company; but a man may be very agreeable, strictly
consistent with truth and sincerity, by a prudent silence where
he can not concur, and a pleasing assent where he can.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2564. Now and then you meet with a person so exactly
formed to please, that he will gain upon every one that hears
or beholds him; this disposition is not merely the gift of nature,
but frequently the effect of much knowledge of the world,
and a command over the passions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2565. <em>Ceremonies.</em>&mdash;All ceremonies are in themselves very
silly things; but, yet a man of the world should know them.
They are the outworks of manners and decency, which would
be too often broken in upon, if it were not for that defense
which keeps the enemy at a proper distance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2566. <em>Therefore</em> always treat fools and coxcombs with
great ceremony, true good-breeding not being a sufficient barrier
against them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2567. <em>Agreeableness.</em>&mdash;The true art of being agreeable is
to appear well-pleased with all the company, and rather to
seem well entertained with them than to bring entertainment
to them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2568. Eschew personalities and personal adventures; nothing
is more tedious than one who is addicted to talk prodigiously
about himself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2569. Never, in a mixed company, speak disrespectfully of
woman.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2570. Treat your parents with the greatest possible respect.
Restrain yourself even from smiling at their foibles, or their
weaknesses. Obey them, even should you yourself be of mature
age.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2571. To restrain your desire for indulgences is not only
well bred, but it is heroic; much good results from it. Watch
well the little sins, and you will escape those which are more
gross. This applies, not only to morals, but to the minor
morals&mdash;the manners.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2572. A badly-tempered man, and he who has no command
over his passions, will rarely become a polished gentleman.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2573. If you have children, be careful to behave well before
them. Remember that the child naturally and easily imitates
the actions of his parent, be they good or evil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2574. Any thing which is essentially out of place is vulgar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
Thus, an over familiarity with servants is vulgar, because it is
out of place, and can only lead to a bad result.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>RULES OF ETIQUETTE.</h4>

<p>2575. In walking with a gentleman, the step of the lady
must be lengthened, and his shortened, to prevent the hobbling
appearance of not keeping step.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2576. Of course, the conversation of a stranger, beyond asking
a necessary question, must be considered as a gross insult,
and repelled with proper spirit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2577. Having dressed yourself, pay no further attention to
your clothes. Few things look worse than a continual fussing
with your attire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2578. Never scratch your head, pick your teeth, clean your
nails, or worse than all, pick your nose in company; all these
things are disgusting. Spit as little as possible, and never
upon the floor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2579. Do not lounge on sofas, nor tip back your chair, nor
elevate your feet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2580. If you are going into the company of ladies, beware
of onions, spirits, and tobacco.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2581. If you can sing or play, do so at once when requested,
without requiring to be pressed, or make a fuss.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2582. On the other hand, let your performance be brief, or,
if ever so good, it will be tiresome.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2583. When a lady sits down to the pianoforte, some gentleman
should attend her, arrange the music-stool, and turn
over the leaves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2584. Do not make yourself too conspicuous in those attentions.
The lady, not the gentleman, is the performer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2585. Never tattle, nor repeat in one society any scandal
or personal matter you hear in another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2586. Give your own opinion of people, if you please, but
never repeat that of others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2587. Meeting an acquaintance among strangers in the
street or a coffee-house, never address him by name. It is
vulgar and annoying.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2588. It is not considered fashionable to introduce two persons
who accidentally meet in your parlor, and who are paying
you a morning visit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2589. Never introduce in the street, unless the third person
joins and walks with you. You may make an exception to
this rule when the parties are mutually desirous of knowing
one another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2590. When a gentleman is presented to a lady, if she is in
her own house and desires to welcome him, she may shake
hands with him; but on any other occasion, unless the gentleman
is venerable, or the bosom friend of the husband or
father, this practice is reprehensible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2591. A lady is at liberty either to take another lady or a
gentleman to pay a morning visit to a friend, without asking
permission; but she should never allow a gentleman the same
liberty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2592. A lady who is invited to an evening assembly may
always request a gentleman who has not been invited by the
lady of the house, to accompany her.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2593. If you are walking with one lady, do not stop to converse
with others who are unknown to her; as she must necessarily
feel unpleasant; but, if with a gentleman, you may do
as you please.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2594. <em>Visits and Presentations.</em>&mdash;Friendship calls should be
made in the forenoon, and require neatness, without costliness
of dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2595. Calls to give invitations to dinner parties, or balls,
should be very short, and should be paid in the afternoon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2596. Visits of condolence require a grave style of dress.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2597. A formal visit should never be made before noon. If
a second visitor is announced, it will be proper for you to
retire, unless you are very intimate, both with the host and the
visitor announced; unless, indeed, the host expresses a wish
for you to remain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2598. Visits after balls or parties should be made within a
month.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2599. In the latter, it is customary to enclose your card in
an envelope, bearing the address outside. This may be sent
by post, if you reside at a distance. But, in the neighborhood,
it is polite to send your servant, or to call. In the
latter case, a corner should be turned down.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2600. Scrape your shoes and use the mat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2601. When a new visitor enters a drawing-room, if it be a
gentleman, the ladies bow slightly; if a lady, the guests rise.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2602. Hold your hat in your hand, unless requested to place
it down. Then lay it beside you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2603. The last arrival in a drawing-room takes a seat left
vacant near the mistress of the house.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2604. A lady is not required to rise on receiving a gentleman,
nor to accompany him to the door.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2605. When your visitor retires, ring the bell for the servant.
You may then accompany your guest as far toward the
door as the circumstances of your friendship seem to demand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2606. Request the servant, during the visit of guests, to be
ready to attend to the door the moment the bell rings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2607. When you introduce a person pronounce the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
distinctly, and say whatever you can to make the introduction
agreeable. Such as "an old and valued friend," a
"school-fellow of mine," "an old acquaintance of our family."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2608. Never stare about you in a room as if you were taking
stock.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2609. The gloves should not be removed during a visit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2610. Be hearty in your reception of guests. And where
you see much diffidence, assist the stranger to throw it off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2611. A lady does not put her address on her visiting card.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2612. In all your associations, keep constantly in view the
adage, "too much freedom breeds contempt."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2613. Never be guilty of practical jokes; if you accustom
yourself to them, it is probable you will become so habituated
as to commit them upon persons who will not allow of such
liberties: I have known a duel to arise from a slap on the
back.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2614. If there be another chair in the room, do not offer a
lady that from which you have just risen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2615. Always suspect the advances of any person who may
wish for your acquaintance, and who has had no introduction:
circumstances may qualify this remark, but as a general principle,
acquaintances made in a public room or place of amusement
are not desirable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2616. Never converse while a person is singing; it is an
insult not only to the singer, but to the company.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2617. The essential part of good breeding is the practical
desire to afford pleasure, and to avoid giving pain. Any man
possessing this desire, requires only opportunity and observation
to make him a gentleman.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2618. Always take off your hat when handing a lady to her
carriage, or the box of a theatre, or a public room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2619. If, in a public promenade, you pass and repass persons
of your acquaintance, it is only necessary to salute them
on the first occasion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2620. Do not affect singularity of dress by wearing any
thing that is so conspicuous as to demand attention; and
particularly avoid what I believe I must call the ruffian style.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2621. Never lose your temper at cards, and particularly
avoid the exhibition of anxiety or vexation at want of success.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2622. If you are playing whist, not only keep your temper,
but hold your tongue; any intimation to your partner is
decidedly ungentlemanly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2623. Let presents to a young lady be characterized by
taste, not remarkable for intrinsic value.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2624. Except under very decided circumstances, it is both
ungentlemanly and dangerous to <em>cut</em> a person: if you wish to
rid yourself of any one's society, a cold bow in the street, and
particular ceremony in the circles of your mutual acquaintance,
is the best mode of conduct to adopt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2625. Never introduce your own affairs for the amusement
of a company; it shows a sad want of mental cultivation, or
excessive weakness of intellect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2626. Recollect, also, that such a discussion cannot be interesting
to others, and that the probability is that the most
patient listener is a complete gossip, laying the foundation for
some tale to make you appear ridiculous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2627. When you meet a gentleman with whom you are
acquainted, you bow, raising your hat slightly with the left
hand, which leaves your right at liberty to shake hands if you
stop.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2628. If the gentleman is ungloved, you must take off yours,
not otherwise.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2629. Meeting a lady, the <em>rule</em> is that she should make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
first salute, or at least indicate by her manner that she recognizes
you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2630. Your bow must be lower, and your hat carried further
from your head: but you never offer to shake hands; that
is <em>her</em> privilege.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2631. The right, being the post of honor, is given to superiors
and ladies, except in the street, when they take the wall,
as furthest from danger from passing carriages, in walking
with or meeting them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2632. In walking with a lady, you are not bound to recognize
gentlemen with whom she is not acquainted, nor have
they, in such a case, any right to salute, much less to speak to
you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2633. Whenever or wherever you stand, to converse with a
lady, or while handing her into or out of a carriage, keep your
hat in your hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2634. Should her shoe become unlaced, or her dress in any
manner disordered, fail not to apprize her of it, respectfully,
and offer your assistance. A gentleman may hook a dress or
lace a shoe with perfect propriety, and should be able to do
so gracefully.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2635. Whether with a lady or gentleman, a street talk
should be a short one; and in either case, when you have
passed the customary compliments, if you wish to continue
the conversation, you must say, "Permit me to accompany
you."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2636. Don't sing, hum, whistle, or talk to yourself, in walking.
Endeavor, besides being well dressed, to have a calm
good-natured countenance. A scowl always begets wrinkles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2637. It is best not to smoke at all in public, and none but
a ruffian in grain will inflict upon society the odor of a bad
cigar, or that of any kind on ladies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2638. Ladies are not allowed, upon ordinary occasions, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
take the arm of any one but a relative or an accepted lover in
the street, and in the day time; but in the evening&mdash;in the fields,
or in a crowd, wherever she may need protection&mdash;she should
not refuse it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2639. The lady should pass her hand over the gentleman's
arm merely, but should not walk at arm's length apart, as
country girls sometimes do.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DINNER PARTIES.</h4>

<p>2640. We will begin with the invitation, the reply to which
you will make at once, for obvious reasons, and address it to
the mistress of the house.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2641. If you accept, arrive at the house very punctually, not
too late nor too early, both are inconvenient, but the latter
irreparable. Get there, therefore, a little before the time, and
wait till the precise moment before knocking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2642. If you arrive by some accident a great deal too late,
do not disturb the party by going in; send your card and an
apology from some neighboring place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2643. The host, if attentive, will point out to gentlemen the
ladies whom he wishes them to conduct to table&mdash;always follow
his directions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2644. If either at dinner or at supper he should offer you
the place of honor, never refuse it. To do so, as some do, is
to show a pretended modesty; it keeps the rest of the company
standing, and is vulgar in the extreme.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2645. The great requisites in the office of host are to be a
good carver (if they carve at table), a calm temper, and a wish
to place every one perfectly at his ease.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2646. The company should be so arranged that each lady
will have some gentleman at her side, to assist her. Of course,
it is every gentleman's duty, first of all to see that ladies near
him are attended to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2647. The lady of the house sits at the head of the table,
and the gentleman opposite, at the foot. The place of honor
for gentlemen, is on each side of the mistress of the house&mdash;for
ladies, on each side of the master.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2648. When napkins are provided, they are at once carefully
unfolded, and laid on the knees.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2649. Observe, if grace is to be said, and keep a proper
decorum. If soup is served, take a piece of bread in the left
hand, and the spoon in the right, and sip noiselessly from the
side of the spoon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2650. Do not take two plates of the same kind of soup, and
never tip up the plate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2651. When regular courses are served, the next dish is
fish. If silver or wide-pronged forks are used, eat with the
fork in the right hand&mdash;the knife is unnecessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2652. If dishes are carved by the servants, they must be
taken to a sideboard from the proper position on the table,
as they are required.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2653. Take whatever is given you if you intend to eat it;
do not offer it to your neighbor, and begin at once to eat.
The stiff formality of waiting till, as it were, all have a fair
start, is vulgar in the extreme.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2654. Attend to the wants of the lady who sits next to you,
but do not watch her plate or use any offensive vulgarism.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2655. The host should never recommend or eulogize any
particular dish; his guests will take it for granted that any
thing found at his table is excellent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2656. The host must not relinquish his knife or fork till his
guests have finished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2657. It is not usual to drink wine with any of the company
present; if you, however, find it the custom where you dine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
adopt it at once. Champagne is drunk between the meats and
the dessert.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2658. Never address a servant, nor ever speak <em>of</em> one at
dinner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2659. Should a gentleman send you wine at a public table,
or ask the honor of a glass with you, observe when he raises
his glass, and do the same, bowing, whether you drink or not.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2660. As a general rule, in helping any one at table, never
use a knife when you can use a spoon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2661. If at dinner you are requested to help any one to
sauce, do not pour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one
side.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2662. If you should have to carve and help a joint, do not
load a person's plate&mdash;it is vulgar; also in serving soup, one
ladleful to each plate is sufficient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2663. Eat peas with a dessert spoon, and curry also. Tarts
and puddings are to be eaten with a spoon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2664. After the dinner, a rose-water dish is passed round;
dip a corner of your napkin in it, and refresh your mouth and
hands. Finger-glasses are not in vogue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2665. Be careful not to drink too much wine; and join the
ladies in the drawing-room as quickly as possible.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2666. Ladies, although allowed a great latitude of dress at
dinner-parties, should never be extravagantly fine.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>BALLS AND EVENING PARTIES.</h4>

<p>2667. An invitation to a ball should be given <em>at least</em> a week
beforehand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2668. Upon entering, first address the lady of the house;
and after her, the nearest acquaintances you may recognize in
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2669. If you introduce a friend, make him acquainted with
the names of the chief persons present. But first present him
to the lady of the house, and to the host.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2670. Appear in full dress.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2671. Always wear gloves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2672. Do not wear rings on the outside of your gloves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2673. Avoid an excess of jewelry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2674. Do not select the same partner frequently.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2675. Distribute your attention as much as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2676. Pay respectful attention to elderly persons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2677. Be cordial when serving refreshments, but not importunate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2678. If there are more dancers than the room will accommodate,
do not join in every dance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2679. In leaving a large party, it is unnecessary to bid farewell,
and improper to do so before the guests.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2680. A Paris card of invitation to an evening party usually
implies that you are invited for the season.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2681. The host and hostess should look after their guests,
and not confine their attentions. They should, in fact, assist
those chiefly who are the least known in the room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2682. Avoid political and religious discussions. If you
have a "hobby," keep it to yourself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2683. After dancing, conduct your partner to a seat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2684. Resign her as soon as her next partner advances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.</h4>

<p>2685. No union should be undertaken until both of the
contracting parties are fully acquainted with each other's disposition.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2686. If either man or woman are subject to indulge in any
foible, or known vice, such as irritability, idleness, love of
scandal, drunkenness, or worse, he or she should not marry
till that vice is conquered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2687. When before union there is an unreasonable, absurd,
and romantic degree of affection, that marriage will probably
be an unhappy one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2688. When a woman knows a man to be addicted to any
known self-indulgence, or to that which the world too frequently
calls pleasure, she should discountenance him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2689. Position in society is frequently reckoned as more
than an equivalent for riches. Yet neither a wise man nor
woman will seek to marry greatly out of their sphere of life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2690. When you are going to marry, do not expect more
from life than life will afford.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2691. For acquirements, look more to solid knowledge,
either in wife or husband, than to accomplishments.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2692. When a young man admires a lady, and thinks her
society necessary to his happiness, it is proper, before committing
himself, or inducing the object of his admiration to do
so, to apply to her parents or guardians for permission to
address her; this is a becoming mark of respect, and the circumstances
must be very peculiar, which would justify a deviation
from this course.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2693. Young men frequently amuse themselves by playing
with the feelings of young women. They visit them often,
they walk with them, they pay them divers attentions, and
after giving them an idea that they are attached to them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
either leave them, or, what is worse, never come to an explanation
of their sentiments. This is to act the character of a
"dangler," a character truly dastardly and infamous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2694. In case of rejection, the gentleman should at once,
unless under peculiar circumstances, abstain from his suit.
Unless he does so, his conduct becomes persecuting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2695. Ladies should never, by the slightest familiarity,
encourage any one whom they would object to marry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2696. Rejection should be courteous, definite, and decisive;
but <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'conched'">couched</span> in a manner that, whilst it deprives the suitor of
hope, inflicts no pain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2697. Engaged people should avoid compliments in company.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2698. A proposal being made, the lady should first signify
her own willingness, and then refer her suitor to her parents.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2699. In public, or in company, the conduct of lovers should
be guarded. Avoid all show of extreme preference. Neither
caress nor chide before others.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2700. Letters, trinkets, and presents, when engagements
are broken off, are always returned by both parties.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2701. Long engagements are dangerous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2702. If a gentleman does not intend to marry a lady, he
has no right to make his attentions peculiar. He should consider
her true interest, and he would not trifle with her affections.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2703. <em>Love's Telegraph.</em>&mdash;If a gentleman wants a wife, he
wears a ring on the <em>first</em> finger of the left hand; if he is
engaged, he wears it on the <em>second</em> finger; if married, on the
<em>third</em>; and on the <em>fourth</em>, if he never intends to be married.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2704. When a lady is not engaged, she wears a hoop or
diamond on her <em>first</em> finger; if engaged, on the <em>second</em>; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
married, on the <em>third</em>; and on the <em>fourth</em>, if she intends to die
a maid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2705. When a gentleman presents a fan, flower, or trinket,
to a lady with the <em>left</em> hand, this on his part, is an overture
of regard; should she receive it with the <em>left</em> hand, it is
considered as an acceptance of his esteem; but if with the
<em>right</em> hand, it is a refusal of the offer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2706. Thus, by a few simple tokens, explained by rule, the
passion of love is expressed: and, through the medium of the
telegraph, the most timid and diffident man may, without
difficulty, communicate his sentiments of regard to a lady, and
in case his offer should be refused, avoid experiencing the
mortification of an explicit refusal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2707. <em>Marriage Ceremony.</em>&mdash;Weddings are everywhere
accompanied with some degree of ceremony, and are usually
considered as occasions of festivity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2708. The preliminaries having been arranged by the contracting
parties, and the lady having named the happy day,
preparations are made for the wedding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2709. Those who belong to the Episcopal and Roman
Catholic churches are usually married at church, in the morning,
and by the prescribed forms.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2710. In some cases there is a wedding-party given in the
evening; in others, the happy couple make a short wedding
tour, and issue cards of invitation on their return.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2711. Where a wedding is celebrated in the usual forms,
cards of invitation are issued at least a week beforehand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2712. The hour selected is usually eight o'clock, P. M.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2713. Wedding cakes, wines, and other refreshments are
provided by the bride and her friends for the occasion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2714. The bride is usually dressed in pure white&mdash;she wears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
a white vail, and her head is crowned with a wreath of white
flowers, usually artificial; and orange blossoms are preferred.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2715. She should wear no ornaments but such as her intended
husband or her father may present her for the occasion&mdash;certainly
no gift, if any such were retained, of any former
sweetheart.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2716. The bridesmaid, or bridesmaids, if there be two, or
more, are generally younger than the bride, and should also
be dressed in white, but more simply.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2717. The bridegroom must be in full dress, that is, he
must wear a dress coat, which if he pleases, may be faced with
white satin; a white satin vest, black pantaloons, and dress
boots or pumps, black silk stockings, and white kid gloves, and
a white cravat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2718. The bridegroom is attended by one or two, or more,
groomsmen, who should be dressed in a similar manner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2719. It is the duty of the bridesmaids to assist in dressing
the bride, and making the necessary preparations for the entertainment
of the guests.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2720. The chief groomsman engages the clergyman or magistrate,
and upon his arrival introduces him to the bride and
bridegroom, and the friends of the parties.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2721. The invited guests, upon their arrival, are received
as at other parties, and after visiting the dressing-rooms, and
arranging their toilettes, they proceed to the room where the
ceremony is to be performed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2722. In some cases the marriage is performed before the
arrival of the guests.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2723. When the hour for the ceremony has arrived, and all
things are ready, the wedding party, consisting of the happy
couple, with the bridesmaids and groomsmen, walk into the
room arm in arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2724. The groomsmen, each attending the bridesmaids, precede
the bride and bridegroom, and take their position at the
head of the room, which is usually the end furthest from the
entrance; the bride standing facing the assembly on the left
of the bridegroom&mdash;the bridesmaids taking their position at
her left, and the groomsmen at the right of the bridegroom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2725. The principal groomsman now formally introduces the
clergyman or magistrate to the bride and bridegroom, and he
proceeds to perform the marriage ceremony; if a ring is to be
used, the bridegroom procures a plain gold one, previously
taking some means to have it of the proper size.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2726. As soon as the ceremony is over, and the bridegroom
has kissed the bride, the clergyman or magistrate shakes hands
with the bride, saluting her by her newly-acquired name, as
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, and wishes them joy, prosperity and happiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2727. Then the groomsmen and bridesmaids do the same;
and then the principal groomsmen brings to them the other
persons in the room, commencing with the parents and relatives
of the parties, the bride's relatives having precedence,
and ladies being accompanied by gentlemen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2728. In this manner, all present are expected to make their
salutations and congratulations, first to the newly-married
couple, and then to their parents and friends.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2729. And where the wedding ceremony has been performed
before the arrival of the guests, they are received near the
door, having, of course, first visited the dressing-rooms, and
are introduced in the same manner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2730. The groomsman takes occasion, before the clergyman
or magistrate leaves, to privately thank him for his attendance,
at the same time placing in his hand the marriage fee, which
is wrapped up nicely in paper, and if more than the legal sum,
as is frequently the case where the parties are wealthy, it is
usually in gold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2731. The bridegroom, of course, takes an early opportunity
to reimburse his groomsman for necessary expenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2732. When the presentations and congratulations are over,
that is, when the guests have arrived, the bridal party, which
till now has kept its position, mingles with the rest of the company,
and joins in the dancing or other amusements.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2733. The practice of kissing the bride is not so common
as formerly, and in regard to this, the taste of the bridegroom
may be consulted, as the rest of the company follow the example
of the groomsman; but the parents and very near relatives
of the parties, of course, act as affection prompts them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2734. When the ceremony is performed according to the
Protestant Episcopal service, the order of going to church is
as follows:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2735. The bride, accompanied by her <em>father</em>, not unfrequently
her <em>mother</em>, and uniformly by a <em>bridesmaid</em>, occupies
the <em>first carriage</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2736. The father hands out the bride, and leads her to the
altar, the mother and bridesmaid following. After them come
the other bridesmaids, attended by the groomsmen, if there
are more than one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2737. <em>The bridegroom</em> occupies the <em>last carriage</em>, with the
principal groomsman, an intimate friend or brother.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2738. He follows, and stands facing the altar, with <em>the bride
at his left hand</em>. The father places himself behind, with the
mother, if she attends.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2739. <em>The chief bridesmaid</em> occupies a place on the <em>left</em>
of the <em>bride</em>, to hold her gloves and handkerchief, and flowers;
her <em>companions</em> range themselves on <em>the left</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2740. Remember to <em>take the ring with you</em>. The fee to
a clergyman is according to the fortune of the bridegroom;
and a trifle should be given to the sexton.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2741. When the ceremony is concluded, <em>the bride takes the
groom's arm</em>, they enter their carriage, and proceed to the
breakfast, every one else following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2742. <em>The order of return from church</em> differs from the
above only in the fact that the bride and bridegroom now ride
together, the bride being on his left, and a bridesmaid, and a
groomsman, or the father of the bride, occupying the front
seats of the carriage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2743. <em>The wedding breakfast</em> having been already prepared,
the wedding party return thereto.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2744. If a large party, the bride and bridegroom occupy
seats in the centre of the long table, and the two extremities
should be presided over by elderly relatives, if possible one
from each family.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2745. Every body should endeavor to make the occasion as
happy as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2746. After marriage, the bridal party usually travel for a
week or two; upon their return, it is customary for the bride
to be at home for a few days to receive visits. The first four
weeks after marriage, constitute the honeymoon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2747. You need not retain the whole of your previous acquaintance;
those only to whom you send cards, are, after
marriage, considered in the circle of your visiting acquaintance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2748. The parents or friends of the bride usually send the
cards to her connections; the bridegroom selects those persons
among his former associates whom he wishes to retain as
such.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2749. The cards are sometimes united by a silken cord, or
white ribbon, to distinguish those of a newly married pair
from ordinary visitors; but it is doubtful whether it be in good
taste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2750. A married woman may leave her own or her husband's
card in returning a visit; the latter only would be
adopted as a resource in the event of her not having her own
with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2751. Cards should (if belonging to the gentleman) be plain,
plainly written or printed, and unglazed and ungilt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2752. Ladies should have their cards enameled, but, for
obvious reasons, the name plain and distinct, so as to catch
the eye at once.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2753. When a man marries, it is understood that all former
acquaintanceship ends, unless he intimate a desire to renew it,
by sending you his own and his wife's card, if near, or by letter,
if distant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2754. If this be neglected, be sure no further intercourse is
desired.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2755. In the first place: A bachelor is seldom very particular
in the selection of his companions. So long as he is
amused, he will associate freely enough with those whose
morals and habits would point them out as highly dangerous
persons to introduce into the sanctity of domestic life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2756. Secondly. A married man has the tastes of another
to consult; and the friends of the husband may not be equally
acceptable to the wife.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2757. Besides, newly-married people may wish to limit
the circle of their friends, from commendable motives of economy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2758. When a man first "<em>sets up</em>" in the world, the burden
of an extensive and indiscriminate acquaintance may be felt in
various ways.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2759. Many have had cause to regret the weakness of mind
which allowed them to plunge into a vortex of gayety and expense
they could ill afford, from which they have found it difficult
to extricate themselves, and the effects of which have
proved a serious evil to them in after life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2760. When a man is about to be married, he usually gives
a dinner to his bachelor friends; which is understood to be
their congé unless he choose to renew their acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2761. <em>Wedding-rings.</em>&mdash;The custom of wearing wedding-rings
appears to have taken its rise among the Romans.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2762. Before the celebration of their nuptials, there was a
meeting of friends at the house of the lady's father to settle
articles of the marriage contract, when it was agreed that the
dowry should be paid down on the wedding-day or soon after.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2763. On this occasion, there was commonly a feast, at the
conclusion of which the man gave to the woman as a pledge,
a ring, which she put on the fourth finger of her left hand, <em>because
it was believed that a nerve reached thence to the heart</em>,
and a day was then named for the marriage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2764. <em>Wedding cakes.</em>&mdash;Four pounds of fine flour, well
dried, four pounds of fresh butter, two pounds of loaf sugar,
a quarter of a pound of mace pounded and sifted fine, the same
of nutmegs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2765. To every pound of flour add eight eggs; wash four
pounds of currants; let them be well picked and dried before
the fire; blanch a pound of sweet almonds, and cut them
lengthwise very thin; a pound of citron, one pound of candied
orange, the same of candied lemon; half a pint of brandy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2766. When these are made ready, work the butter with
your hand to a cream, then beat in your sugar, a quarter of
an hour, beat the whites of your eggs to a very strong froth;
mix them with your sugar and butter; beat your eggs half an
hour at least, and mix them with your cake; then put in your
flour, mace and nutmeg; keep beating it well till your oven
is ready&mdash;pour in the brandy, and beat the currants and
almonds lightly in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2767. Tie three sheets of white paper round the bottom of
your hoop to keep it from running out; rub it well with butter,
put in your cake, lay the sweetmeats in layers, with cake
between each layer, and after it is risen and colored, cover it
with paper before your oven is stopped up; it will require
three hours to bake properly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2768. <em>Almond Icing for Wedding Cake.</em>&mdash;Beat the whites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
of three eggs to a strong froth; beat a pint of Jordan almonds
very fine with rose-water; mix them, with the eggs, lightly
together; put in by degrees a pound of common loaf sugar in
powder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2769. When the cake is baked enough, take it out, and lay
it on the icing; then put it in to brown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2770. <em>After Marriage.</em>&mdash;The power of a wife for good or
evil, is irresistible. Home must be the seat of happiness, or
it must be for ever unknown.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2771. A good wife is to a man, wisdom and courage, and
strength and endurance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2772. A bad wife is confusion, weakness, discomfiture, and
despair.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2773. No condition is hopeless where the wife possesses firmness,
decision, and economy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2774. There is no outward prosperity which can counteract
indolence, extravagance, and folly at home. No spirit can
long endure bad domestic influence.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2775. Man is strong, but his heart is not adamant. He delights
in enterprise and action; but to sustain him he needs a
tranquil mind, and a whole heart. He needs his moral force
in the conflicts of the world.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2776. To recover his equanimity and composure, home must
be to him a place of repose, of peace, of cheerfulness, of comfort;
and his soul renews its strength again, and goes forth
with fresh vigor to encounter the labor and troubles of life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2777. But if at home he finds no rest, and is there met with
bad temper, sullenness, or gloom, or is assailed by discontent
or complaint, hope vanishes, and he sinks into despair.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2778. A wife must learn, to form her husband's happiness,
in what direction the secret lies; she must not cherish his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
weaknesses by working upon them; she must not rashly run
counter to his prejudices; her motto must be, never to irritate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2779. She must study never to draw largely on the small
stock of patience in a man's nature, nor to increase his obstinacy
by trying to drive him; never, never, if possible, to have
scenes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2780. We doubt much if a real quarrel, even made up, does
not loosen the bond between man and wife, and sometimes,
unless the affection of both be very sincere, lastingly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2781. If irritation should occur, a woman must expect to
hear from most men a strength and vehemence of language far
more than the occasion requires. Mild, as well as stern men,
are prone to this exaggeration of language; let not a woman
be tempted to say any thing sarcastic or violent in retaliation.
The bitterest repentance must needs follow if she do.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2782. Men frequently forget what they have said, but seldom
what is uttered by their wives. They are grateful, too,
for forbearance in such cases; for, whilst asserting most loudly
that they are right, they are often conscious that they are
wrong.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2783. Give a little time, as the greatest boon you can bestow,
to the irritated feelings of your husband.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2784. It is astonishing how much the cheerfulness of a wife
contributes to the happiness of home.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2785. She is the sun&mdash;the centre of a domestic system, and
her children are like planets around her, reflecting her rays.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2786. How merry the little ones look when the mother is
joyous and good-tempered; and how easily and pleasantly her
household labors are overcome!</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2787. <em>How to Treat a Wife.</em>&mdash;First, get a wife; secondly,
be patient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2788. You may have great trials and perplexities in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
business with the world, but do not carry to your home a
clouded or contracted brow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2789. Your wife may have had many trials, which, though
of less magnitude, may have been as hard to bear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2790. A kind, conciliating word, a tender look, will do
wonders in chasing from her brow all clouds of gloom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2791. You encounter difficulties in the open air, fanned by
heaven's cool breezes; but your wife is often shut in from these
healthful influences, and her health fails, and her spirits lose
their elasticity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2792. But oh! bear with her; she has trials and sorrows to
which you are a stranger, but which your tenderness can deprive
of all their anguish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2793. Notice kindly her little attentions and efforts to promote
your comfort.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2794. Do not treat her with indifference, if you would not
sear and palsy her heart, which, watered by kindness, would,
to the latest day of your existence, throb with sincere and
constant affection.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2795. Sometimes yield your wishes to hers. She has preferences
as strong as you, and it may be just as trying to
yield her choice as to you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2796. Do you find it hard to yield sometimes? Think you
it is not difficult for her to give up always?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2797. If you never yield to her wishes, there is danger that
she will think you are selfish, and care only for yourself, and
with such feelings she can not love as she might.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2798. Again, show yourself manly, so that your wife can
look up to you and feel that you will act nobly, and that she
can confide in your judgment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2799. You can hardly imagine how refreshing it is to occasionally
call up the recollection of your courting days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span></p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2800. How tediously the hours rolled away prior to the appointed
time of meeting; how swift they seemed to fly, when
met; how fond was the first greeting; how tender the last
embrace; how fervent were your vows; how vivid your dreams
of future happiness, when, returning to your home, you felt
yourself secure in the confessed love of the object of your
warm affections.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2801. Is your dream realized?&mdash;are you as happy as you
expected?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2802. Why not? Consider whether as a husband you are
as fervent and constant as you were when a lover.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2803. Remember that the wife's claims to your unremitting
regard&mdash;great before marriage, are now exalted to a much
higher degree.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2804. She has left the world for you&mdash;the home of her
childhood, the fireside of her parents, their watchful care and
sweet intercourse have all been yielded up for you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2805. Look then most jealously upon all that may tend to
attract you from home, and to weaken that union upon which
your temporal happiness mainly depends; and believe that in
the solemn relationship of husband is to be found one of the
best guarantees for man's honor and happiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2806. When once a man has established a home, his most
important duties have fairly begun.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2807. The errors of youth may be overlooked; want of purpose,
and even of honor, in his earlier days, may be forgotten.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2808. But from the moment of his marriage he begins to
write his indelible history; not by pen and ink, but by actions&mdash;by
which he must ever afterward be reported and judged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2809. His conduct at home; his solicitude for his family;
the training of his children; his devotion to his wife; his regard
for the interests of eternity, are his record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2810. Seek to govern your own household by the display
of high moral excellence.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2811. A domineering spirit&mdash;a fault-finding petulance&mdash;impatience
of trifling delays&mdash;and the exhibition of unworthy
passions at the slightest provocation, can add no laurel to
your own "lordly" brow, impart no sweetness to home, and call
forth no respect from those by whom you may be surrounded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2812. It is one thing to be a <em>master</em>&mdash;another thing to be
a <em>man</em>. The latter should be the husband's aspiration; for
he who can not govern himself is ill-qualified to govern
another.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>OUR HOUSE.</h4>

<p>2813. <em>If a young married couple</em> intend to furnish a house,
we say to them&mdash;Attend to these rules.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2814. Do not spend all your money, be it much or little.
Do not let the beauty of this thing, and the cheapness of that,
tempt you to buy unnecessary articles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2815. Buy merely enough to get along with at first. It is
only by experience that you can tell what will be the wants
of your family.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2816. If you spend all your money, you will find you have
purchased many things you do not want, and have no means
left to get many things which you do want.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2817. If you have enough, and more than enough, to get
every thing suitable to your situation, do not think you must
spend it all, merely because you happen to have it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2818. Begin humbly. As riches increase, it is easy and
pleasant to increase in comforts; but it is always painful and
inconvenient to decrease. After all, these things are viewed
in their proper light by the truly judicious and respectable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2819. Neatness, tastefulness, and good sense may be shown
in the management of a small household, and the arrangement
of a little furniture, as well as upon a larger scale; and these
qualities are always praised, and always treated with respect
and attention.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2820. The consideration which many purchase by living
beyond their income, and, of course, living upon others, is not
worth the trouble it costs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2821. The glare there is about this false and wicked parade
is deceptive: it does not, in fact, procure a man valuable
friends, or extensive influence.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2822. <em>If the house is rented.</em>&mdash;Before taking a house, be
careful to calculate that the rent is not too high in proportion
to your means; for remember that the rent is a claim which
must be paid with but little delay, and that the landlord has
greater power over your property than any other creditor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2823. Having determined the amount of rent which you
can afford to pay, be careful to select the best house which
can be obtained for that sum. And in making that selection,
let the following matters be carefully considered:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2824. First.&mdash;Carefully regard the healthfulness of the situation.
Avoid the neighborhood of graveyards, and of factories
giving forth unhealthy vapors; avoid low and damp districts,
the course of canals, and localities of reservoirs of water,
gas-works, &amp;c.; make inquiries as to the drainage of the neighborhood,
and inspect the drainage and water supply of the
premises.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2825. A house standing on an incline is likely to be better
drained than one standing upon the summit of a hill, or on a
level below a hill.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2826. Endeavor to obtain a position where the direct sun-light
falls upon the house, for this is absolutely necessary to
health; and give preference to a house the openings of which
are sheltered from the north and east winds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2827. Second.&mdash;Consider the distance of the house from
your place of occupation; and also its relation to provision
markets, and the prices that prevail in the neighborhood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2828. Having considered these material and leading features,
examine the house in detail, carefully looking into its
state of repair.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2829. Notice the windows that are broken; whether the
chimneys smoke; whether they have been recently swept;
whether the paper on the walls is damaged, especially in the
lower parts, and the corners by the skirtings; whether the locks,
bolts, handles of doors, and window-fastenings are in proper
condition; make a list of the fixtures.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2830. Ascertain whether all rent and taxes were paid up
by the previous tenant, and whether the party from whom you
take the house is the original landlord, or his agent or tenant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2831. And do not commit yourself by the signing of any
agreement until you are satisfied upon all these points, <em>and
see that all has been done which the landlord had undertaken</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2832. <em>In the country</em>, the married couple usually go to a
house of their own.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2833. <em>Our House!</em>&mdash;It is a phrase of great importance,
and gives dignity to the newly married.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2834. <em>Society.</em>&mdash;Social intercourse is necessary to our happiness
and improvement.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2835. <em>Conversation</em> is the medium by which social intercourse
is maintained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2836. Style in conversation is as important, and as capable
of cultivation, as style in writing. The manner of saying
things is what gives them their value.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2837. Avoid provincialisms in your language and pronunciation.
Webster is the standard for pronouncing in the
best society in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2838. Under favorable circumstances, and among persons
who know how to train a conversation, there are few if any
amusements more grateful to the human mind.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2839. The object of conversation is to entertain and amuse.
To be agreeable you must learn to be a good listener. A
man who monopolizes a conversation is a bore, no matter how
great his knowledge.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2840. Never get into a dispute. State your opinions, but
do not argue them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2841. Do not contradict; and above all, never offend by
correcting mistakes or inaccuracies of fact or expression.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2842. Never lose temper&mdash;never notice a slight&mdash;never
seem conscious of an affront, unless it is of a gross character,
and then punish it at once.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2843. You can never quarrel in the presence of ladies, but
a personal indignity may be avenged <em>anywhere</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2844. Never talk of people by hints, slurs, innuendos, and
such mean devices. If you have any thing to say, out with it.
Nothing charms more than candor, when united with good
breeding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2845. Do not call people by their names, in speaking to
them. In speaking of your own children, never "Master" and
"Miss" them&mdash;in speaking to other people of theirs, never
neglect to do so.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2846. Be very careful in speaking of subjects upon which
you are not acquainted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2847. Much is to be learned by confessing your ignorance&mdash;nothing
<span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'can be by'">can be gained by</span> pretending to knowledge which you do not
possess.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2848. Never tell long stories. Avoid all common slang
phrases and pet words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2849. Of all things, don't attempt to be too fine. Use
good honest English&mdash;and common words for common things.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2850. Good sense, sound and varied information, are as
necessary as confidence, to enable a man to converse well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2851. Every one knows something which he is willing to
tell, and which any other that he is in company with wishes to
know, or which if known to him, would be amusing or useful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2852. To be a skillful conversationist, one's eyes and ears
should be busy; nothing should escape his observation. His
memory should be a good one, and he should have a good-natured
willingness to please and to be pleased.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2853. Avoid a loud tone, particularly in speaking to ladies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2854. By observing men of the world, you will perceive
that their voices, as it were, involuntarily assume a softness
as they address the sex; this is one of the most obvious proofs
of an intimacy with good society.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2855. Never attempt to occupy the attention of a company
for a long time; unless your conversation is very brilliant, it
must become very tiresome.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2856. Be not partial to theorizing, or your conversation
will assume the style of speech-making, which is intolerable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2857. Badinage is pleasant, but it may be dangerous; stupid
people may imagine you are ridiculing them, and the stupid
are the most assiduous enemies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2858. Abjure punning; it has been aptly designated "the
wit of fools." Gentlemen never pun.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2859. A tattler is a most contemptible character, uniting in
person either excessive ignorance, folly, and vanity, or the extremes
of meanness, mischief and malignity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2860. Women ordinarily slander more from vanity than
vice&mdash;men, from jealousy than malignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2861. Without intending mischief, many persons do much
by repeating conversations from one house to another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2862. A man should never permit himself to lose his temper
in society, nor show that he has taken offense at any supposed
slight&mdash;it places him in a disadvantageous position&mdash;betraying
an absence of self-respect, or at the least of self-possession.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2863. If, upon the entrance of a visitor, you continue a conversation
begun before, you should always explain the subject
to the new-comer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2864. There cannot be a custom more vulgar or offensive
than that of taking a person aside to whisper in a room with
company, yet this rudeness is of frequent occurrence&mdash;and
that with persons who ought to know better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2865. Questions upon that which does not immediately concern
you, are impertinent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2866. Be well read, for the sake of the general company
and the ladies, in the literature of the day. You will, thereby,
enlarge the regions of pleasurable talk. Besides, it is often
necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2867. Hazlitt, who had entertained an unfounded prejudice
against Dickens's works when they were first written, confesses
that at last he was obliged to read them, because he could not
enter a mixed company without hearing them admired and
quoted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2868. Always avoid any thing like absence of mind. Some
fops assume this, but it is silly and contemptible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2869. In order to put everybody in the company at ease,
we should adopt the manners and customs of those with whom
we happen for the time to consort.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2870. People who, having traveled, adopt, as many do, foreign
phraseology, idiom, or accent, are excessively vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2871. Be especially careful, in a mixed company, whom you
satirize.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2872. Swearing, which formerly pervaded every rank of
society, is now to be chiefly found in a very low and uninstructed
class; it is, in fact, a vulgar and proscribed mode of
speech.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2873. To those who are guilty of it, for these reasons it is
only necessary to point out, that no well-informed person can
be at the least loss, with the genuine words of the English
language, to express all legitimate ideas and feelings; and that
to use either profane or slang words is, at the least, the indication
of a low taste and inferior understanding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2874. Never presume to cultivate an over-familiarity of
manner, which is always offensive; rather be reserved&mdash;even
to your best friends. If you proceed with members of your
family to a party, do not be seen talking with them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2875. Try to make every one at their ease; and if you find
other people are not so well bred as you could wish, take the
will for the deed, and never show, nor attempt to show, your
disgust at them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2876. Try heartily to please everybody, and you will be
pleased yourself; and, besides this, render yourself the most
agreeable person in the room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2877. Should you chance to be thrown into the company
of what the man in the farce calls a real live lord, do not interlard
your talk with "my lord," and "your lordship." Sir
is sufficient, after once addressing him as "my lord," to show
that you <em>are</em> acquainted with his rank. Madam is to be used
to a lady of title, to whom also the previous rule applies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2878. There are many talkers, but few who know how to
converse agreeably.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2879. Speak distinctly, neither too rapidly nor too slowly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2880. Accommodate the pitch of your voice to the hearing
of the person with whom you are conversing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2881. Never speak with your mouth full.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2882. Tell your jokes and laugh afterward.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2883. Dispense with superfluous words&mdash;such as "Well, I
should think."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2884. In society we sometimes meet opionated, selfish people,
who fancy they know every thing, when in reality they
know nothing!</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2885. The real end of acquiring a polite manner is to make
yourself pleasing, and your company acceptable to all. This
must be done by little sacrifices&mdash;by curbing, if you be plagued
with it, your desire to engross the conversation, or, on the
contrary, breaking through your habitual taciturnity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2886. The woman who wishes her conversation to be agreeable,
will avoid conceit or affectation, and laughter which is not
natural and spontaneous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2887. Her language will be easy and unstudied, marked by
a graceful carelessness, which, at the same time, never oversteps
the limits of propriety.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2888. Her lips will readily yield to a pleasant smile; she
will not love to hear herself talk; her tones will bear the impress
of sincerity, and her eyes kindle with animation, as she
speaks.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2889. The art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good
breeding; for the precise object of the latter is to render us
agreeable to all with whom we associate; to make us, at the
same time, esteemed and loved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2890. We need scarcely advert to the rudeness of interrupting
any one who is speaking, or to the impropriety of pushing,
to its full extent, a discussion which has become unpleasant.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2891. Some men have a mania for Greek and Latin quotations;
this is peculiarly to be avoided. It is like pulling up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
the stones from a tomb wherewith to kill the living. Nothing
is more wearisome than pedantry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2892. If you feel your intellectual superiority to any one
with whom you are conversing, do not seek to bear him down;
it would be an inglorious triumph, and a breach of good
manners.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2893. Beware, too, of speaking lightly of subjects which
bear a sacred character.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2894. Witlings occasionally gain a reputation in society;
but nothing is more insipid and in worse taste than their conceited
harangues and self-sufficient air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2895. It is a common idea that the art of writing and the
art of conversation are one; this is a great mistake. A man
of genius may be a very dull talker.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2896. The two grand modes of making your conversation
interesting, are to enliven it by recitals calculated to affect
and impress your hearers, and to intersperse it with anecdotes
and smart things.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2897. It follows that all matter of offense in conversation
should be avoided. The self-love of others is to be respected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2898. Therefore, no one is tolerated who makes himself the
subject of his own commendation, nor who disregards the feelings
of those whom he addresses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2899. There is as much demand for politeness and civility
in conversation as in any other department of social intercourse.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>2900. One who rudely interrupts another, does much the
same thing as though he should, when walking with another,
impertinently thrust himself before his companion, and stop his
progress.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2901. <em>Rules of Conduct.</em>&mdash;The following excellent rules are
from the diary of Mrs. Fry:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2902. 1. Never lose any time; I do not think that lost
which is spent in amusement or recreation, some time every
day; but always be in the habit of being employed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2903. 2. Never err the least in truth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2904. 3. Never say any ill thing of a person when thou
canst say a good thing of him; not only speak charitably, but
feel so.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2905. 4. Never be irritable or unkind to any body.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2906. 5. Never indulge thyself in luxuries that are not necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2907. 6. Do all things with consideration; and, when thy
path to act right is most difficult, feel confidence in that Power
alone which is able to assist thee, and exert thy own powers
as far as they go.</p>

<p class="hsumm"><em>How to Preserve Health&mdash;Bathing, etc.&mdash;Medicine&mdash;Ointments&mdash;Blisters&mdash;Poultices,
etc.&mdash;Cholera&mdash;Domestic Surgery,
etc.&mdash;Riches&mdash;Temperance&mdash;Dr. Franklin's Way to
Wealth.</em></p>

<h4>THE PRESERVATION OF HEALTH.</h4>

<p>2908. In another place (see "Health and Beauty," p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>,
etc.), I have given many useful hints on this subject.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2909. Still more may be told; and new suggestions, cautions,
and remedies will be found in the following pages.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2910. <em>These Rules</em> are given to persuade people to take
care and preserve their health; not to induce them needlessly
to doctor themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2911. <em>The First Rule</em> for those in health is&mdash;take no medicine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2912. <em>The Second Rule.</em>&mdash;In sickness, send for the best
physicians; viz., those who give least medicine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2913. Pure atmospheric air is composed of nitrogen, oxygen,
and a <em>very</em> small proportion of carbonic acid gas. Air
once breathed has lost the chief part of its oxygen, and
acquired a proportionate increase of carbonic acid gas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2914. Therefore, health requires that we breathe the same
air once only.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2915. The solid part of our bodies is continually wasting,
and requires to be repaired by fresh substances.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2916. Therefore, food, which is to repair the loss, should be
taken with due regard to the exercise and waste of the body.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2917. The fluid part of our bodies also wastes constantly;
there is but one fluid in animals, which is water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2918. Therefore, water only is necessary, and no artifice
can produce a better drink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2919. The fluid of our bodies is to the solid in proportion
as nine to one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2920. Therefore, a like proportion should prevail in the
total amount of food taken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2921. Light exercises an important influence upon the
growth and vigor of animals and plants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2922. Therefore, our dwellings should freely admit the solar
rays.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2923. Decomposing animal and vegetable substances yield
various noxious gases, which enter the lungs and corrupt the
blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2924. Therefore, all impurities should be kept away from
our abodes, and every precaution be observed to secure a
pure atmosphere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2925. Warmth is essential to all the bodily functions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2926. Therefore, an equal bodily temperature should be
maintained by exercise, by clothing, or by fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2927. Exercise warms, invigorates, and purifies the body;
clothing preserves the warmth the body generates; fire imparts
warmth externally.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2928. Therefore, to obtain and preserve warmth, exercise
and clothing are preferable to fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2929. Fire consumes the oxygen of the air, and produces
noxious gases.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2930. Therefore, the air is less pure in the presence of
candles, gas, or coal fire, than otherwise; and the deterioration
should be repaired by increased ventilation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2931. The skin is a highly-organized membrane, full of
minute pores, cells, blood-vessels, and nerves; it imbibes
moisture or throws it off, according to the state of the atmosphere
and the temperature of the body. It also "breathes,"
as do the lungs (though less actively). All the internal
organs sympathize with the skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2932. Therefore, it should be repeatedly cleansed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2933. Late hours and anxious pursuits exhaust the nervous
system, and produce disease and premature death.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2934. Therefore, the hours of labor and study should be
short.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2935. Mental and bodily exercise are equally essential to
the general health and happiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2936. Therefore labor and study should succeed each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2937. Man will live most healthily upon simple solids and
fluids, of which a sufficient but temperate quantity should be
taken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2938. Therefore, strong drinks, tobacco, snuff, opium, and
all mere indulgences should be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2939. Sudden alternations of heat and cold are dangerous,
especially to the young and the aged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2940. Therefore, clothing, in quantity and quality, should be
adapted to the alterations of night and day, and of the seasons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2941. And therefore, also, drinking cold water when the
body is hot, and hot tea and soups when cold, are productive
of many evils.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2942. Moderation in eating and drinking, short hours of
labor and study, regularity in exercise, recreation, and rest,
cleanliness, equanimity of temper and equality of temperature,
these are the great essentials to that which surpasses all wealth,
<em>health of mind and body</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2943. <em>Bed Clothes.</em>&mdash;The perfection of dress, for day or
night, where warmth is the purpose, is that which confines
around the body sufficient of its own warmth, while it allows
escape to the exhalations of the skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2944. Where the body is allowed to bathe protractedly in
its own vapors, we must expect an unhealthy effect upon the
skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2945. Where there is too little ventilating escape, insensible
perspiration is checked, and something analogous to fever
supervenes; foul tongue, ill taste, and lack of morning appetite
betray the evil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2946. <em>Early Rising.</em>&mdash;Dr. Wilson Philip, in his "Treatise
on Indigestion," says: "Although it is of consequence to the
debilitated to go early to bed, there are few things more hurtful
to them than remaining in it too long."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2947. Getting up an hour or two earlier, often gives a
degree of vigor which nothing else can procure.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2948. For those who are not much debilitated, and sleep
well, the best rule is to get out of bed soon after waking in
the morning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2949. This at first may appear too early, for the debilitated
require more sleep than the healthy; but rising early will
gradually prolong the sleep on the succeeding night, till the
quantity the patient enjoys is equal to his demand for it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2950. Lying late is not only hurtful, by the relaxation it
occasions, but also by occupying that part of the day at which
exercise is most beneficial.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2951. The difference between rising every morning at six
and at eight, in the course of forty years, amounts to 29,200
hours, or three years one hundred and twenty-one days and
sixteen hours, which are equal to eight hours a day for exactly
ten years.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2952. Thus, rising at six will be the same as if ten years of
life (a weighty consideration) were added, wherein we may
command eight hours every day for the cultivation of our
minds and the dispatch of business.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2953. <em>Development of the Lungs.</em>&mdash;Much has been said and
written upon diet, eating and drinking, but I do not recollect
ever noticing a remark in any writer upon breathing, or the
manner of breathing. Multitudes, and especially ladies in easy
circumstances, contract a vicious and destructive mode of
breathing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2954. They suppress their breathing, and contract the habit
of short, quick breathing, not carrying the breath half way
down the chest, and scarcely expanding the lower portions of
the chest at all.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2955. Lacing the bottom of the chest also greatly increases
this evil, and confirms a bad habit of breathing. Children
that move about a great deal in the open air, and in no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
laced, breathe deep and full to the bottom of the chest, and
every part of it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2956. So also with most out-door laborers, and persons who
take much exercise in the open air, because the lungs give us
the power of action; and the more exercise we take, especially
out of doors, the larger the lungs become, and are the less
liable to disease.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2957. In all occupations that require standing, keep the
person straight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2958. If at table, let it be high; raised up nearly to the
armpits, so as not to require you to stoop; you will find the
employment much easier&mdash;not one half so fatiguing; whilst
the form of the chest and symmetry of the figure will remain
perfect.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4><span class="smcap">BATHS, &amp;c.</span><br />
(<span class="pfs70">SEE PAGES</span> <a href="#Page_124">124</a> <span class="pfs70">AND</span> <a href="#Page_125">125</a>.)</h4>

<p>2959. Water is the means of personal purification. Use it
freely.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2960. <em>Bathing.</em>&mdash;If to preserve health be to save medical
expenses, without even reckoning upon time and comfort, there
is no part of the household arrangement so important to the
domestic economist as cheap convenience for personal ablution.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2961. Whoever fits up a bath in a house already built, must
be guided by circumstances; but it will always be proper to
place it as near the kitchen fire-place as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2962. From thence it may be heated, or at least have its
temperature preserved by means of hot air through tubes, or
by steam prepared by the culinary fire-place, without interfering
with its ordinary uses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2963. A small boiler may be erected at a very small expense,
in the bath-room, where circumstances do not permit these
arrangements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2964. Whenever a bath is wanted at a short warning, to
boil the water necessary will always be the shortest mode; but
where it is in general daily use, the heating the water by steam
will be found the cheapest and most convenient method.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2965. <em>Bathing tubs</em> should never be left with water in them
that has been used. Let off the water, and keep them dry as
possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2966. <em>A hand-bath</em> is always to be had when regular bathing
is not convenient. With a piece of sponge or an extra
towel to wash with, your ablutions may be well performed
every day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2967. <em>Tepid water</em>, or even quite warm water, will greatly
refresh the system after violent fatigue; but if a warm bath is
taken, do not stay in it over ten minutes&mdash;indeed <em>five minutes</em>
is long enough.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2968. <em>In cold bathing</em> it should never be forgotten that
every thing depends upon the general power of the individual,
the state of the system, especially of the skin, at the moment
of immersion, and the season of the year.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2969. If the reaction does not speedily take place, means
must be employed to insure its so doing, or the use of the cold
bath must be abandoned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2970. Delicate and feeble persons of all ages require a
higher temperature of the bath, and a shorter stay in it than
others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2971. No person should bathe immediately after a full meal,
particularly if there be an apoplectic tendency.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2972. For a person in good health, early in the morning is
the best time to bathe; for one more delicate, from two to
three hours after breakfast is preferable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2973. Never think of undressing and going into the water
when greatly fatigued, or when the skin is covered with perspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2974. In most cases moderate exercise is advantageous
before bathing, but not exercise of a violent kind.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2975. <em>Hints about Children.</em>&mdash;The attempt to harden children
by exposure to too great a degree of cold, is of the most
injurious nature.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2976. For infants and young children, it is clear that water
of a lower temperature than what feels cool to the hand of
the nurse should be used; but not <em>cold</em> water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2977. <em>Cold bathing</em> either produces acute diseases of the
lungs, which are then very sensible to external impressions, or
disease of the digestive organs, leading to disease of the mesenteric
glands, scrofula, water in the brain, or, if they survive
a few years, to early consumption.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2978. <em>Wet the Head.</em>&mdash;It is a good rule to wet the head
before taking a plunge or a bath.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2979. "<em>Cleanliness</em> is next to godliness," is a maxim of
Christian philosophy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2980. <em>Exercise.</em>&mdash;Exercise in the open air is of the first
importance to the human frame, yet how many are in a manner
deprived of it by their own want of management of their
time!</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2981. Women with slender means are for the most part destined
to in-door occupations, and have but little time allotted
them for taking the air, and that little time is generally sadly
encroached upon by the ceremony of dressing to go out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2982. Whereas, if all were in readiness, the preparations
might be accomplished in a few minutes, the walk not being
curtailed by unnecessary delays.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2983. It may appear a simple suggestion, but experience
only will show how much time might be redeemed by habits
of regularity; such as putting the shawls, cloaks, gloves, shoes,
&amp;c., &amp;c., or whatever is intended to be worn, in readiness, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
of having to search one drawer, then another, for possibly
a glove or collar&mdash;wait for shoes being cleaned, &amp;c.&mdash;and
this when (probably) the out-going persons have to return to
their employment at a given time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2984. Three principal points in the manner of taking exercise
are necessary to be attended to:&mdash;1. The kind of exercise.
2. The proper time for exercise. 3. The duration of it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2985. With respect to the kinds of exercise, the various
species of it may be divided into active and passive. Among
the first, which admits of being considerably diversified, may
be enumerated, walking, running, leaping, swimming, riding,
fencing, the military exercise, different sorts of athletic
games, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2986. Among the latter, or passive kinds of exercise, may
be comprised riding in a carriage, sailing, friction, swinging,
&amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2987. The first, or active exercises, are more beneficial to
youth, to the middle-aged, to the robust in general, and particularly
to the corpulent and the plethoric.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2988. The second or passive kinds of exercise, on the contrary,
are better calculated for children; old, dry, and emaciated
persons of a delicate and debilitated constitution; and
particularly to the asthmatic and consumptive.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2989. The time at which exercise is most proper, depends
on such a variety of concurrent circumstances, that it does not
admit of being regulated by any general rules, and must therefore
be collected from the observations made on the effects
of air, food, drink, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2990. With respect to the duration of exercise, there are
other particulars, relative to a greater or less degree of fatigue
attending the different species and utility of it in certain
states of the mind and body, which must determine this consideration
as well as the preceding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2991. That exercise is to be preferred which, with a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
to brace and strengthen the body, we are most accustomed to,
as any unusual one may be attended with a contrary effect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2992. Exercise should be begun and finished gradually,
never abruptly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2993. Exercise in the open air has many advantages over
that used within doors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2994. To continue exercise until a profuse perspiration or
a great degree of weariness takes place, is far from being
wholesome.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2995. In the forenoon, when the stomach is not too much
distended, muscular motion is both agreeable and healthful;
it strengthens digestion, and heats the body less than with a
full stomach; and a good appetite after it is a proof that it
has not been carried to excess.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2996. But, at the same time, it should be understood, that
it is not advisable to take violent exercise immediately before
a meal, as digestion might thereby be retarded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2997. Neither should we sit down to a substantial dinner
or supper immediately on returning from a fatiguing walk, at
a time when the blood is heated, and the body in a state of
perspiration from previous exertion, as the worst consequences
may arise, especially where cooling dishes, salad, or a glass
of cold drink is begun with.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2998. Exercise is always hurtful after meals, from its impeding
digestion, by propelling those fluids too much toward
the surface of the body which are designed for the solution of
the food in the stomach.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>2999. <em>Climate.</em>&mdash;The action of medicines is modified by
climate and seasons. In summer, certain medicines act more
powerfully than in winter, and the same person cannot bear
the dose in July that he could in December.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3000. <em>General Health.</em>&mdash;Persons whose general health is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
good, bear stronger doses than the debilitated and those who
have suffered for a time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3001. <em>Idiosyncrasy.</em>&mdash;Walker will inform you that this long
term means a peculiar temperament or disposition not common
to people generally.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3002. For example, some persons cannot take calomel in
the smallest dose without being salivated, or rhubarb without
having convulsions; others cannot take squills, opium, senna,
&amp;c., therefore it is wrong to <em>insist</em> upon their taking these
medicines.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3003. <em>Forms best suited for Administration.</em>&mdash;Fluids act
quicker than solids, and powders sooner than pills.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3004. <em>Best method of Preventing the Nauseous Taste of
Medicine.</em>&mdash;Castor oil may be taken in milk, coffee, or spirits
such as brandy; but the best method of covering the nauseous
flavor, is to put a table-spoonful of strained orange-juice in a
wine-glass, pour the castor oil into the centre of the juice, and
then squeeze a few drops of lemon-juice upon the top of the
oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3005. Cod-liver oil may be taken, like castor oil, in orange-juice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3006. Peppermint water almost prevents the nauseous taste
of Epsom salts; a strong solution of extract of liquorice covers
the disagreeable taste of aloes; milk, that of cinchona bark;
and cloves that of senna.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3007. An excellent way to prevent the taste of medicines
is to have the medicine in a glass, as usual, and a tumbler of
water by the side of it, then take the medicine and retain it in
the mouth, which should be kept closed, and if you then commence
drinking the water, the taste of the medicine is washed
away.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3008. Even the bitterness of quinine and aloes may be
prevented by this means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3009. <em>Giving Medicine to Persons.</em>&mdash;Medicines should be
given in such a manner that the effect of the first dose should
not have ceased when the next dose is given, therefore the intervals
between the doses should be regulated accordingly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3010. <em>Doses of Medicine for different Ages.</em>&mdash;It must be
plain to every one that children do not require such powerful
medicine as adults or old people.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3011. Be careful to give the least possible dose that will
have effect. The less medicine swallowed, the better for the
patient.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

to relieve deep-seated inflammations when other means cannot
be employed, as they are more easily applied locally.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

can bear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3090. <em>Anodyne and Discutient.</em>&mdash;Take two drachms of

<h4>ENEMAS</h4>

<p>3104. Are a peculiar kind of medicine, administered by injecting
them into the rectum or outlet of the body.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3105. The intention is either to empty the bowels, kill
worms, protect the lining membrane of the intestines from
injury, restrain copious discharges, allay spasms in the bowels,
or nourish the body. These clysters, or glysters, are administered
by means of bladders and pipes, or a proper apparatus.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3120. <em>Extracts</em> are made by evaporating the liquors obtained
by infusion or decoction, but these can be bought much
cheaper and better of chemists and druggists, and so can tinctures,
confections, cerates, plasters, and syrups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3121. <em>Method of Ascertaining the State of the Lungs.</em>&mdash;Persons
desirous of ascertaining the true state of their lungs, are
directed to draw in as much breath as they conveniently can;
they are then to count as far as they are able, in a slow and
audible voice, without drawing in more breath.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3122. The number of seconds they can continue counting
must be carefully observed; in a consumption the time does
not exceed ten, and is frequently less than six seconds; in
pleurisy and pneumonia it ranges from nine to four seconds.
When the lungs are in a sound condition, the time will range
as high as from twenty to thirty-five seconds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3123. <em>Appetite.</em>&mdash;Appetite is frequently lost through excessive
use of stimulants, food taken too hot, sedentary occupation,
costiveness, liver disorder, and want of change of air.
The first endeavor should be to ascertain and remove the
cause.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3124. Change of diet, and change of air, will frequently be
found more beneficial than medicines.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3125. <em>Bile, Bilious or Liver Complaints.</em>&mdash;Abstinence from
malt liquors, cool homœopathic cocoa for drink, no tea or coffee,
few vegetables, and little bread; bacon in a morning, and well-cooked
fresh animal food once a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3126. One common cause of putrid and malignant fevers is
the want of cleanliness.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>POULTICES.<br />
[<span class="pfs70">SEE PAGES</span> <a href="#Page_112">112</a>,

<p>3127. Poultices should be applied as hot as the patient can
bear. Cold poultices do no good; remove them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3128. <em>Apple Poultice.</em>&mdash;Apples pared, cored and well
boiled, then well washed into a pulp, form a very good
poultice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3129. <em>Starch Poultice.</em>&mdash;Starch, any quantity; thicken with
boiling water. When a little cool, stir in a little lard or oil.</p>

meal, one part. Make into a paste with water. A little
oil or lard should be added to prevent its sticking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3133. <em>Poultice made of Hops.</em>&mdash;Boil a handful of hops for
a few minutes in a pint of water, in a covered vessel, squeeze

added as it becomes cool.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

and finger stir it into a curd.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3136. <em>Ginger Poultice.</em>&mdash;Wet flannel in hot vinegar and
sprinkle on ground ginger&mdash;good for toothache.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3137. <em>Hot Water.</em>&mdash;In bruises, hot water is most efficacious,
both by means of insertion and fomentation, in removing pain,
and totally preventing discoloration and stiffness. It has the
same effect after a blow. It should be applied as quickly as
possible, and as hot as it can be borne.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3138. Insertion in hot water will cure that troublesome
and fearful thing called a whitlow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3139. The efficacy of hot water in preventing the ill effects
of fatigue is too well known to require notice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<p>3144. <em>Mucilage of Gum Arabic.</em>&mdash;Rub one ounce of gum
arabic in a mortar, with four ounces of warm water. <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'Use for for'">Use for</span>
coughs, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3145. <em>Mucilage of Starch.</em>&mdash;Rub one drachm of starch with

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3146. Use for enemas, topical application and demulcent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3147. <em>Cutaneous Eruptions.</em>&mdash;The following mixture is
very useful in all cutaneous eruptions:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3148. Ipecacuanha wine, four drachms; flowers of sulphur,
two drachms; tincture of cardamoms, one ounce. Mix.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3149. Dose&mdash;one teaspoonful to be taken three times a day,
in a wine-glassful of water. (See page <a href="#Page_232">232</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3150. <em>Small Pox Marks.</em>&mdash;Long observation has convinced
me that nothing so effectually removes these disfigurements as
gently rubbing the face with a soft towel immediately after
washing. This practice, which is free from the objections
which may be made against external applications (which are
usually violent irritants), quickens the circulation of the blood,
producing exfoliation and the formation of new tissues, and at
the same time restoring to the cheek its healthy color, which
is generally lost by confluent small-pox.&mdash;<em>Dr. Cox.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3151. Mental and bodily exercise are equally essential to the
general health and happiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3152. Therefore, labor and study should succeed each other.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3153. Man will live most healthily upon simple solids and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
fluids, of which a sufficient but temperate quantity should be
taken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3154. Therefore, strong drinks, tobacco, snuff, opium, and
all mere indulgences should be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<h4>SPECIAL RULES FOR THE PREVENTION OF CHOLERA.</h4>

<p>3155. We urge the necessity, in all cases of cholera, of an
instant recourse to medical aid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3156. Also under every form and variety of indisposition:
for all disorders are found to merge in the dominant disease.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3157. Let immediate relief be sought under disorder of the
bowels especially, however slight. The invasion of cholera
may thus be readily prevented.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3158. Let every impurity, animal and vegetable, be quickly
removed to a distance from the habitations, such as slaughter-houses,
pig-sties, cesspools, necessaries, and all other domestic
nuisances.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3159. Let all uncovered drains be carefully and frequently
cleansed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3160. Let the grounds in and around the habitations be
drained, so as effectually to carry off moisture of every kind.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3161. Let all partitions be removed from within and without
habitations, which unnecessarily impede ventilation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3162. Let every room be daily thrown open for the admission
of fresh air; this should be done about noon, when the
atmosphere is most likely to be dry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3163. Let dry scrubbing be used in domestic cleansing in
place of water cleansing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3164. Let excessive fatigue, and exposure to damp and
cold, especially during the night, be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3165. Let the use of cold drinks and acid liquors, especially
under fatigue, be avoided, or when the body is heated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3166. Let the use of cold acid fruits and vegetables be
avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3167. Let excess in the use of ardent and fermented liquors
and tobacco be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<p>3169. Let the wearing of wet and insufficient clothes be
avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3170. Let a flannel or woolen belt be worn round the person.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3171. Let personal cleanliness be carefully observed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3172. Let every cause tending to depress the moral and
physical energies be carefully avoided. Let exposure to
extremes of heat and cold be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3173. Let crowding of persons within houses and apartments
be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3174. Let sleeping in low or damp rooms be avoided.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3175. Let fires be kept up during the night in sleeping or
adjoining apartments, the night being the period of most danger
from attack, especially under exposure to cold or damp.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3176. Let all bedding and clothing be daily exposed during
winter and spring to the fire, and in summer to the heat of the
sun.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3177. Let the dead be buried in places remote from the
habitation of the living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3178. By the timely adoption of simple means such as
these, cholera or other epidemics will be made to lose its
venom.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>RULES FOR A SICK ROOM.</h4>

<p>3179. See pages <a href="#Page_236">236</a> and <a href="#Page_237">237</a>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3180. Keep the patient, and all about him, perfectly clean;
and secure, as far as possible, pure air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3181. The chamber should be ventilated at least once a day,
or twice if it can be borne.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3182. The bed clothes should be carried out into the open
air, if it is dry, if not, into the next room; and if the patient
is unable to sit up meanwhile, let them be supplied by others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3183. Keep the room quiet, and in perfect order.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3184. Let the sick be addressed in a gentle voice, and the
conversation, if any is admitted, be pleasant and cheering.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3185. The nurse and friends should express sympathy with
the sufferer, but at the same time seek to inspire courage, and
patience to endure.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3186. All vials and powders should be labeled, to prevent
fatal mistakes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3187. The beds should be made at least once a day, and if
the patient can bear it, twice. Carry the beds out into the
open air, or if damp, into another room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3188. Keep the skin clean by daily ablutions: change the
garments frequently, and rinse the mouth often.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3189. A nurse should be of a pleasant, agreeable, persuasive,
and even temper, with great patience to bear with the
whims and unreasonable fretfulness that often appear in the
sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3190. Never dispute with a very sick person, nor reprove
him for any seeming inconsistency. Remember that he is
scarcely a responsible being.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3191. <em>To prevent Pitting after Small-Pox.</em>&mdash;Spread a
sheet of thin leather with the ointment of ammoniacum with
mercury, and cut out a place for the mouth, eyes, and nostrils.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3192. This forms what is called a mask, and after anointing
the eye-lids with a little blue ointment (<em>unguentum hydrargyri</em>),
it should be applied to the face, and allowed to remain
for three days for the distinct kind, and four days for the running
variety. <em>Period to apply it</em>:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3193. <em>Before</em> the spots fill with matter, although it will
answer sometimes even after they have become pustulous. It
may be applied to any part in the same way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3194. <em>Precautions to be Observed in giving Medicines.&mdash;Sex.</em>&mdash;Medicines
for females should not be so strong as those
for males, therefore it is advisable to reduce the doses about
one-eighth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3195. <em>Temperament.</em>&mdash;Persons of a phlegmatic temperament
bear stimulants and purgatives better than those of a
sanguine temperament; therefore the latter require smaller
doses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3196. <em>Habits.</em>&mdash;Purgatives never act so well upon persons
accustomed to take them, as upon those who are not; therefore
it is better to change the form of purgative from pill to
potion, powder to draught, or aromatic to saline. Purgatives
should never be given when there is an irritable state of the
bowels.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3197. Stimulants and narcotics never act so quickly upon
persons accustomed to use spirits freely as upon those who
live abstemiously.</p>

<h4>DOMESTIC SURGERY.</h4>

<p>3198. This will comprise such hints and advice as will enable
any one to act on an emergency, or in ordinary trivial
accidents requiring simple treatment; and also to distinguish
between serious and simple accidents, and the best means to
adopt in all cases that are likely to fall under a person's
notice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3199. These hints will be of the utmost value to the heads
of families, to emigrants, and to persons who are frequently
called upon to attend upon the sick.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3200. We strongly recommend the parent, emigrant or nurse
to read over these directions occasionally, to regard it as a
duty, to do so at least three or four times a year, so as to be
prepared for emergencies whenever they may arise.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3201. When accidents occur, people are too excited to acquire
immediately a knowledge of what they should do; and
many lives have been lost for want of this knowledge.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3202. Study, therefore, at moderate intervals, the domestic
surgery, treatment of poisons, rules for the prevention of accidents,
how to escape from fires, &amp;c., which will be found in
various pages of this book.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3203. Let it be impressed upon your mind that the <em>Index</em>
will enable you to refer to any thing you may require in a
moment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3204. <em>Dressings</em> are substances usually applied to parts
for the purpose of soothing, promoting their reunion when
divided, protecting them from external injuries, as a means of
applying various medicines, to absorb discharges, protect the
surrounding parts, and securing cleanliness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3205. Certain instruments are required for the application
of dressings in domestic surgery, viz.&mdash;Scissors, a pair of
tweezers, or simple forceps, a knife, needles and thread, a razor,
a lancet, a piece of lunar caustic in a quill, and a sponge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3206. The materials required for dressings, consist of lint,
scraped linen, carded cotton, tow, ointment spread on calico,
adhesive plaster, compresses, pads, poultices, old rags of linen
or calico, and water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3207. The following rules should be attended to in applying
dressings. Always prepare the new dressings before
removing the old ones.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3208. Always have hot and cold water at hand, and a
vessel to place the foul dressings in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3209. Have one or more persons at hand ready to assist,
and tell each person what they are to do before you commence,
it prevents confusion; thus, one is to wash out and hand the
sponges, another to heat the adhesive plaster, or hand the
bandages and dressings, and, if requisite, a third to support
the limb, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3210. Always stand on the outside of a limb to dress it.
Place the patient in as easy a position as possible, so as not
to fatigue him. Arrange the bed <em>after</em> changing the dressings,
but in some cases you will have to do so before the patient
is placed on it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3211. Never be in a hurry when applying dressings, do it
quietly. When a patient requires moving from one bed to
another, the best way is for one person to stand on each side
of the patient, and each to place an arm behind his back,
while he passes his arms over their necks; then let their other
arms be passed under his thighs, and by holding each other's
hands, the patient can be raised with ease, and removed to
another bed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3212. If the leg is injured, a third person should steady it,
and if the arm, the same precaution should be adopted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3213. Sometimes a stout sheet is passed under the patient,
and by several people holding the sides, the patient is lifted
without any fatigue or much disturbance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3214. <em>Lint</em> may be made in a hurry, by nailing the corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
of a piece of old linen to a board, and scraping its surface
with a knife. It is used either alone or spread with ointment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3215. Scraped lint is the fine filaments from ordinary lint,
and is used to stimulate ulcers and absorb discharges; it is
what the French call <em>charpie</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3216. Scraped lint is made into various shapes, for particular
purposes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3217. For example, when it is screwed up into a conical or
wedge-like shape, it is called <em>a tent</em>, and is used to dilate fistulous
openings, so as to allow the matter to escape freely, to
plug wounds, so as to promote the formation of a clot of
blood, and thus arrest bleeding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3218. When it is rolled into little balls they are called <em>boulettes</em>,
and are used for absorbing matter in cavities, or blood
in wounds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3219. Carded cotton is used as a dressing for superficial
burns, and care should be taken to free it from specks, as flies
are apt to lay their eggs there, and generate maggots.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3220. Tow is chiefly employed as a padding for splints, as
compresses, and also as an outer dressing where there is much
discharge from a surface.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3221. Ointments are spread on calicoes, lint, or even thin
layers of tow by means of a knife; they should not be spread
too thick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3222. Adhesive plaster is cut into strips, ranging in width
according to the nature of the wound, &amp;c., but the usual width
is about three-quarters of an inch.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3223. Isinglass plaster is not so irritating as diachylon, and
is more easily removed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3224. <em>Compresses</em> are made of pieces of linen, calico, lint,
or tow, doubled or cut into various shapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3225. They are used to confine dressings in their places,
and to apply an equal pressure on parts.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3226. They should be free from darns, hems, and knots.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3227. Ordinary compresses are square, oblong, and triangular.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3228. The <em>pierced compress</em> is made by folding up a square
piece of linen five or six times on itself, and then nicking the
surface with scissors, so as to cut out small pieces.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3229. It is then opened out, and spread with ointment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3230. It is applied to discharging surfaces, for the purpose
of allowing the matter to pass freely through the holes, and is
frequently covered with a thin layer of tow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3231. Compresses are also made in the shape of a Maltese
cross, and half a cross, sometimes split singly, and at other
times doubly: or they are graduated by placing square pieces
of folded cloth on one another, so arranged that they decrease
in size each time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3232. They are used for keeping up pressure upon certain
parts.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3233. <em>Pads</em> are made by sewing tow inside pieces of linen,
or folding linen and sewing the pieces together. They are
used to keep off pressure from parts, such as that caused by
splints in fractures.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>BANDAGES.</h4>

<p>3234. Bandages are strips of calico, linen, flannel, muslin, elastic
webbing, bunting, or some other substance, of various lengths,
such as three, four, eight, ten, or twelve yards, and one, one
and a-half, two, two and a-half, three, four, or six inches wide,
free from hems or darns; soft and unglazed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3235. They are better after they have been washed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3236. Bandages are simple and compound; the former are
simple slips rolled up tightly like a roll of ribbon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3237. There is also another simple kind which is rolled from
both ends&mdash;this is called a double-headed bandage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3238. The compound bandages are formed of many pieces.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3239. Bandages for the head should be two inches wide and
five yards long; for the neck, two inches wide and three yards
long; for the arm, two inches wide and seven yards long; for
the leg, two inches and a half wide and seven yards long; for
the thigh, three inches wide and eight yards long; and for the
body, four or six inches wide and ten or twelve yards long.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3240. To apply a single-headed bandage, lay the <em>outside of
the end</em> next to the part to be bandaged, and to hold the roll
between the little, ring, and middle fingers and the palm of
the left hand, using the thumb and fore-finger of the same
hand to guide it, and the right hand to keep it firm, and pass
the bandage partly round the leg toward the left hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3241. It is sometimes necessary to reverse this order, and
therefore it is well to be able to use both hands.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3242. <em>Circular</em> bandages are used for the <em>neck</em>, to retain
dressings on any part of it, or for blisters, setons, &amp;c.; for the
<em>head</em>, to keep dressings on the forehead or any part contained
within a circle passing round the head; for the <em>arm</em>, previous
to bleeding; for the <em>leg</em>, above the knee; and for the <em>fingers</em>,
&amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3243. <em>To confine the ends of bandages</em> some persons use
pins, others slit the end for a short distance, and tie the
two strips into a knot, and some use a strip of adhesive
plaster.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3244. Always place the point of a pin in such a position
that it should not be likely to prick the patient, or the person
dressing the limb, or be likely to draw out by using the limb:
therefore, as a general rule, turn the head of the pin from the
free end of the bandage, or toward the upper part of the limb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3245. The <em>oblique</em> bandage is generally used for arms and
legs, to retain dressings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3246. The <em>spiral</em> bandage is generally applied to the trunk
and extremities, but it is apt to fall off even when very carefully
applied: therefore we generally use another called the
recurrent, which folds back again.</p>


<hr class="r10" /><a name="X3247" id="X3247"></a>
<p>3247. The <em>recurrent</em> bandage is the best kind of bandage
that we can employ for general purposes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3248. The <em>circular</em> bandage is formed by horizontal turns,
each of which overlaps the one made before it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3249. The <em>spiral</em> consists of spiral turns.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3250. The <em>oblique</em> follows a course oblique or slanting to
the centre of the limb.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3251. The <em>recurrent</em> folds back again to the part whence
it started.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3252. A <em>bandage for the chest</em> is always placed upon the
patient in a sitting posture; and it may be put on in circles
or spirally.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3253. Use, in fractures of the ribs, to retain dressings, and
after severe contusions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3254. <em>A bandage for the belly</em> is placed on the patient as
directed in the last; if spirally, carrying it from above downward.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3255. Use, to compress the belly after dropsy, or retain
dressings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3256. The <em>hand</em> is bandaged by crossing the bandage over
the back of the hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3257. Use, to retain dressings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3258. For the <em>head</em>, a bandage may be circular, or spiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
or both; in the latter case, commence by placing one circular
turn just over the ears; then bring down from left to right,
and round the head again, so as to alternate a spiral with a
circular turn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3259. Use, to retain dressings on the head or over the eye;
but this form soon gets slack. The circular bandage is the
best, crossing it over both eyes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3260. <em>For the Foot.</em>&mdash;Place the end just above the outer
ankle, and make two circular turns, to prevent its slipping;
then bring it down from the inside of the foot over the instep
toward the outer part; pass it under the sole of the foot, and
upward and inward over the instep toward the inner ankle,
then round the ankle, and repeat again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3261. Use, to retain dressings to the instep, heel or ankle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3262. <em>For the leg and foot</em>, commence and proceed as
directed in <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;this ref. is incorrect; probably meant to be 3212"><a href="#X2213">2213;</a></span>
then continue it up the leg as ordered in <a href="#X3247">3247.</a></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3263. As it sometimes happens that it is necessary to apply
a bandage at once, and the materials are not at hand, it is
desirable to know how to substitute something else <em>that any
one may apply with ease</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3264. This is found to be effected by handkerchiefs, and an
experienced surgeon has paid great attention to this subject,
and brought it to much perfection. It is to him, therefore,
that we are indebted for most of these hints.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3265. Any ordinary handkerchief will do; but a square of
linen, folded into various shapes, answers better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3266. The shapes generally required are as follows:&mdash;The
triangle, the long square, the cravat, and the cord.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3267. The <em>triangular handkerchief</em> is made by folding it
from corner to corner. Use, as a bandage for the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3268. <em>Application.</em>&mdash;Place the base round the head, and the
short part hanging down behind, then tie the long ends over it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3269. The <em>long-square</em> is made by folding the handkerchief
into three parts, or double it once upon itself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3270. Use, as a bandage to the ribs, belly, &amp;c. If one
handkerchief is not long enough, sew two together.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3271. The <em>cravat</em> is folded as usual with cravats. Use, as
a bandage for the head, arms, legs, feet, neck, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3272. The <em>cord</em> is used to compress vessels, when a knot is
made in it, and placed over the vessel to be compressed. It
is merely a handkerchief twisted in its long diameter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3273. Sometimes it is necessary to apply two or more
handkerchiefs, as in a broken collar-bone, or when it is necessary
to keep dressings under the arm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3274. It is applied by knotting the two ends of one handkerchief
together, passing the left arm through it, then passing
another handkerchief under the right arm, and tying it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3275. By this means we can brace the shoulders well back,
and the handkerchief will press firmly over the broken collar-bone;
besides, this form of bandage does not readily slip or
get slack, but it requires to be combined with the sling, in
order to keep the arm steady.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3276. When a woman has an inflamed breast that requires
support or dressings to be kept to it, tie two ends of the
handkerchief round her neck, and bring the body of it over
the breast, and pass it upward and backward under the arm
of that side, and tie the ends of those around the neck.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3277. An excellent sling is formed by placing one handkerchief
around the neck, and knotting the two ends over the
breast-bone, then placing the other in triangle under the arm,
to be supported with the base near to the hand; tie the ends
over the handkerchief, and pin the top to the other part after
passing it around the elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3278. <em>Apparatus.</em>&mdash;When a person receives a severe contusion
of the leg or foot, or breaks his leg, or has painful
ulcers over the leg, or is unable from some cause to bear the
pressure of the bed-clothes, it is advisable to know how to
keep them from hurting the leg.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3279. This may be done by bending up a fire-guard, or
placing a chair, resting upon the edge of its back and front
of the seat over the leg, or putting a box on each side of it,
and placing a plank over them; but the best way is to make
a <em>cradle</em>, as it is called.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3280. This is done by getting three pieces of wood, and
three pieces of iron wire, and passing the wire or hoop through
the wood. This can be placed to any height, and is very
useful in all cases where pressure cannot be borne.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3281. Wooden hoops cut in halves answer better than the
wire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3282. When a person breaks his leg, and <em>splints</em> cannot be
had directly, get a bunch of straw or twigs, and roll it up in a
handkerchief, and place one on each side of the leg or arm, and
bind another handkerchief firmly around them, or make a long
bag about three inches in diameter, or even more, of coarse
linen duck, or carpet, and stuff this full of bran, sawdust, or
sand; sew up the end, and use this the same as the twigs. It
forms an excellent extemporaneous splint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3283. Another good plan is to get a hat-box made of chip,
and cut it into suitable lengths, or for want of all these, some
bones out of a pair of stays, and run them through a stout
piece of rug, protecting the leg with a fold of rug, linen, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3284. When dry warmth is required to be applied to any
part of the body, fry a flour pancake and lay it over the part;
or warm some sand and place in the patient's socks, and lay it
to the part; salt does as well, and may be put into a paper
bag; or warm water put into ginger-beer bottles or stone jars,
and rolled up in flannel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3285. <em>Violent shocks</em> will sometimes stun a person, and he
will remain unconscious.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3286. Untie strings, collars, &amp;c.; loose any thing that is
tight, and interferes with the breathing; raise the head; see
if there is bleeding from any part; apply smelling-salts to the
nose, and hot bottles to the feet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3287. <em>In concussion</em>, the surface of the body is cold and
pale, and the pulse weak and small, the breathing slow and
<em>gentle</em>, and the pupil of the eye generally contracted or small.
You can get an answer by speaking loud, so as to arouse the
patient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3288. Give a little brandy and water, keep the place quiet,
apply warmth, and do not raise the head too high. If you
tickle the feet, the patient feels it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3289. <em>In Compression of the Brain</em>, from any cause, such
as apoplexy, or a piece of fractured bone pressing on it, there
is loss of sensation. If you tickle the feet, he does not feel it.
You cannot arouse him so as to get an answer. The pulse is
slow and labored, the breathing slow, labored, and <em>snorting</em>;
the pupils enlarged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3290. Raise the head, unloose strings or tight things, and
send for a surgeon. If one cannot be got at once, apply mustard-poultices
and hot water to the feet, and leeches to the
temples; or cold water, which is better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3291. <em>Choking.</em>&mdash;When a person has a fish bone in the
throat, insert the forefinger, press upon the root of the tongue,
so as to induce vomiting; if this does not do, let them swallow
a <em>large piece</em> of potato or soft bread; and if these fail, give a
mustard or soap emetic.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3292. <em>Fainting, Hysterics, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Loosen the garments,
bathe the temples with water or Eau de Cologne: fresh air;
avoid bustle and excessive sympathy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3293. <em>Apparent Death from Drunkenness.</em>&mdash;Raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
head, unloose the clothes, maintain warmth of surface, and give
a mustard emetic as soon as the person can swallow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3294. <em>Apoplexy, and Fits generally.</em>&mdash;Raise the head; unloose
all tight clothes, strings, &amp;c.; apply cold lotions to the
head and cold water, and use hot applications to the feet.
Send for a doctor as soon as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3295. <em>Suffocation</em> from noxious gases, &amp;c. Remove to the
fresh air: dash cold vinegar and water in the face, neck and
breast; keep up the warmth of the body; if necessary, apply
mustard-poultices to the soles of the feet, and try artificial
respiration as in drowning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3296. <em>Lightning and Sun-stroke.</em>&mdash;Treat the same as apoplexy;
that is, use plenty of cold water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3297. <em>Hanging.</em>&mdash;Loose the cord, or whatever suspended
the person, and proceed as for drowning, taking the additional
precaution to apply eight or ten leeches to the temples, or
cold water.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>LEECHES AND THEIR APPLICATION.</h4>

<p>3298. The leech used for medical purposes is called the
<em>Hirudo medicinalis</em>, to distinguish it from other varieties, such
as the horse-leech and the Lisbon leech.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3299. It varies from two to four inches in length, and is of
a blackish brown color, marked on the back with six yellow
spots, and edged with a yellow line on each side.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3300. Formerly leeches were supplied by Sweden, but latterly
most of the leeches are procured from France, where
they are now becoming scarce.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3301. When leeches are applied to a part, it should be
thoroughly freed from down or hair by shaving, and all liniments,
&amp;c., carefully and effectually cleaned away by washing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3302. If the leech is hungry it will soon bite, but sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
great difficulty is experienced in getting them to fasten on.
When this is the case, roll the leech into a little porter, or
moisten the surface with a little blood, or milk, or sugar and
water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3303. Leeches may be applied by holding them over the part
with a piece of linen cloth or by means of an inverted glass,
under which they must be placed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3304. When applied to the gums, care should be taken to
use a leech glass, as they are apt to creep down the patient's
throat; a large swan's quill will answer the purpose of a leech
glass.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3305. When leeches are gorged they will drop off themselves;
never <em>tear</em> them off from a person, but just dip the
point of a moistened finger into some salt, and touch them
with it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3306. Be sure never to allow any one to go to sleep with
leech bites bleeding, without watching them carefully; and
never apply too many to children.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3307. If a leech is accidentally swallowed, or by any means
gets into the body, employ an emetic, or enema of salt and
water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3308. It is to be hoped that these disgusting worms will
soon be banished with the lancet from the practice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3309. <em>Taking blood</em> is now conceded, by the best physicians,
to be injurious.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3310. "<em>The life is the blood.</em>"&mdash;Whoever takes away blood,
weakens life.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_127">127</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3311. <em>Bruises and Inflammation.</em>&mdash;Use warm water; bathings
are better than scarifications.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3314. <em>Body in Flames.</em>&mdash;Lay the person down on the floor
of the room, and throw the tablecloth, rug, or other large
cloth over him, and roll him on the floor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3315. <em>Dirt in the Eye.</em>&mdash;Place your forefinger upon the
cheekbone, having the patient before you; then draw up the
finger and you will probably be able to remove the dirt; but
if this will not enable you to get at it, repeat this operation
while you have a netting-needle or bodkin placed over the eye-lid;
this will turn it inside out, and enable you to remove the
sand, or eyelash, &amp;c., with the corner of a fine silk handkerchief.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3316. As soon as the substance is removed, bathe the eye
with warm water and exclude the light for a day. If the inflammation
is severe, take a purgative and use a refrigerant
lotion. (969.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3317. <em>Lime in the Eye.</em>&mdash;Syringe it well with warm vinegar
and water (one ounce to eight ounces of water); take a purgative,
and exclude light.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3318. <em>Iron or Steel Spiculæ in the Eye.</em>&mdash;This occurs while
turning iron or steel in a lathe.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3319. Drop a solution of sulphate of copper (from one to
three grains of the salt to one ounce of water) into the eye,
or keep the eye open in a wine-glassful of the solution.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3320. Take a purgative, bathe with cold lotion, and exclude
light to keep down inflammation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3321. <em>Dislocated Thumb.</em>&mdash;This is frequently produced by
a fall. Make a clove hitch, by passing two loops of cord over
the thumb, placing a piece of rag under the cord to prevent
it cutting the thumb; then pull in the same line as the thumb.
Afterward apply a cold lotion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3322. <em>Cuts and Wounds.</em>&mdash;Cut thin strips of sticking-plaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
and bring the parts together; or if large and deep,
cut two broad pieces so as to look like the teeth of a comb,
and place one on each side of the wound, which must be
cleaned previously.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3323. These pieces must be arranged so that they shall interlace
one another; then, by laying hold of the pieces on the
right hand side with one hand, and those on the other side
with the other hand, and pulling them from one another, the
edges of the wound are brought together, and without any
difficulty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3324. <em>Hemorrhage</em>, when caused by an artery being divided
or torn, may be known by the blood <em>jumping</em> out of the wound,
and being of a bright scarlet color.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3325. If a vein is injured, the blood is darker, and flows
continuously. To stop the latter, apply pressure by means of
a compress and bandage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3326. To arrest arterial bleeding, get a piece of wood (part
of a mop-handle will do), and tie a piece of tape to one end
of it; then tie a piece of tape loosely over the arm, and pass
the other end of the wood under it; twist the stick round and
round until the tape compresses the arm sufficiently to arrest
the bleeding, and then confine the other end by tying the
string round the arm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3327. If the bleeding is very obstinate, and it occurs in the
<em>arm</em>, place a cork underneath the string, on the inside of the
fleshy part, where the artery may be felt beating by any one;
if in the <em>leg</em>, place a cork in the direction of a line drawn from
the inner part of the knee a little to the outside of the groin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3328. It is an excellent thing to accustom yourself to find
out the position of these arteries, or indeed any that are superficial,
and to explain to everyone in your house where they are,
and how to stop bleeding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3329. If a stick cannot be got, take a handkerchief, make a cord
bandage of it, and tie a knot in the middle; the knot acts as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
compress, and should be placed over the artery, while the two
ends are to be tied around the thumb.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3330. Observe always <em>to place the ligature between the wound
and the heart</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3331. Putting your finger into a bleeding wound, and
making pressure until a surgeon arrives, will generally stop
violent bleeding.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3332. <em>Bleeding from the nose</em>, from whatever cause, may
generally be stopped by putting a plug of lint into the nostrils.&mdash;See
pp. <a href="#Page_95">95-6</a>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3333. <em>In dangerous accidents always send off for a surgeon
immediately an accident occurs, but treat as directed until he
arrives.</em></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>RICHES.</h4>

<p>3335. "The way to wealth," says Doctor Franklin, "is as
plain as the way to market."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3336. Many men, however, either miss the way, or stumble
and fall on the road.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3337. Fortune, they say, is a fickle dame&mdash;full of her freaks
and caprices; who blindly distributes her favors without the
slightest discrimination. So inconstant, so wavering is she
represented, that her most faithful votaries can place no reliance
on her promises.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3338. Disappointment, they tell us, is the lot of those who
make offerings at her shrine. Now, all this is a vile slander
upon the dear blind lady.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3339. Although wealth often appears the result of mere
accident, or a fortunate concurrence of favorable circumstances,
without any exertion of skill or foresight, yet every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
man of sound health and unimpaired mind may become wealthy,
if he takes the proper steps.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3340. Foremost in the list of requisites, are honesty and
strict integrity in every transaction of life. Let a man have
the reputation of being fair and upright in his dealings, and
he will possess the confidence of all who know him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3341. Without these qualities, every other merit will prove
unavailing. Ask concerning a man, "Is he active and capable?"
Yes. "Industrious, temperate, and regular in his
habits?" O yes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3342. "Is he honest? is he trustworthy?" Why, as to
that, I am sorry to say that he is not to be trusted; he wants
watching; he is a little tricky, and will take an undue advantage,
if he can.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3343. "Then I will have nothing to do with him:" will be
the invariable reply.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3344. In a word, it is almost impossible for a dishonest
man to acquire wealth by a regular process of business, because
he is shunned as a depredator upon society.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3345. Needy men are apt to deviate from the rule of integrity,
under the plea that <em>necessity</em> knows no law; they might
as well add that it knows no shame.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3346. The course is suicidal, and by destroying all confidence,
ever keeps them immured in poverty, although they may
possess every other quality for success in the world.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3347. Punctuality, which is said to be the soul of business,
is another important element in the art of money-getting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3348. Therefore be prompt in your payments.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3349. Next, let us consider the advantages of a cautious
circumspection in our intercourse with the world. Slowness
of belief, and a proper distrust are essential to success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3350. The credulous and confiding are ever the dupes of
knaves and impostors. Ask those who have lost their property
how it happened, and you will find in most cases it has
been owing to misplaced confidence.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3351. One has lost by endorsing; another by crediting;
another by false representations; all of which a little more
foresight and a little more distrust would have prevented.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3352. In the affairs of this world, men are not saved by
faith, but by the want of it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3353. Judge of men by what they do, not by what they
say. Believe in looks rather than in words.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3354. Before trusting a man, before putting it in his power
to cause you a loss, possess yourself of every available information
relative to him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3355. Learn his history, his habits, inclinations and propensities;
his reputation for honesty, industry, frugality, and
punctuality; his prospects, resources, supports, advantages
and disadvantages; his intentions and motives of action; who
are his friends and enemies, and what are his good or bad
qualities.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3356. You may learn a man's good qualities and advantages
from his friends&mdash;his bad qualities and disadvantages from his
enemies. Make due allowance for exaggeration in both.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3357. Finally, examine carefully before engaging in any
thing, and act with energy afterward. Have the hundred
eyes of Argus beforehand, and the hundred hands of Briareus
afterward.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3358. Order and system in the management of business
must not be neglected. Nothing contributes more to dispatch.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3359. Do first what presses most, and having determined
what is to be done, and how it is to be done, lose no time in
doing it. Without this method, all is hurry and confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
little or nothing is accomplished, and business is attended to
with neither pleasure nor profit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3360. A polite, affable deportment is recommended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3361. Take two men, possessing equal advantages in every
other respect, but let one be gentlemanly, kind, obliging, and
conciliating in his manners; the other harsh, rude, and disobliging,
and the one will become rich, while the other will
starve.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3362. <em>Industry.</em>&mdash;We are now to consider a very important
principle in the business of money-getting, namely&mdash;<em>Industry</em>&mdash;persevering,
indefatigable, attention to business.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3363. Persevering diligence is the philosopher's stone, which
turns every thing to gold. Constant, regular, habitual, and
systematic application to business must, in time, if properly
directed, produce great results.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3364. It must lead to wealth, with the same certainty that
poverty follows in the train of idleness and inattention.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3365. It has been truly remarked, that he who follows his
amusements instead of his business, will, in a short time, have
no business to follow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3366. The art of money-saving is an important part of the
art of money-getting. Without frugality, no one can become
rich; with it, few would be poor. Those who consume as fast
as they produce, are on the road to ruin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3367. As most of the poverty we meet with grows out of
idleness and extravagance, so most large fortunes have been
the result of habitual industry and frugality.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3368. The practice of economy is as necessary in the expenditure
of time as of money. They say that if "we take
care of the pence, the pounds will take care of themselves."
So, if we take care of the minutes, the days will take care of
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3669. Away, then, with your expensive follies, and you will
not then have so much cause to complain of hard times, heavy
taxes, and chargeable families.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3370. Many, for the sake of finery on the back, have gone
with a hungry stomach, and half starved their families.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3371. The acquisition of wealth demands as much self-denial,
and as many sacrifices of present gratification, as the
practice of virtue itself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3372. Vice and poverty proceed, in some degree, from the
same sources, namely&mdash;the disposition to sacrifice the future
to the present; the inability to forego a small present pleasure
for great future advantages.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3373. Men fail of fortune in this world, as they fail of happiness
in the world to come, simply because they are unwilling
to deny themselves momentary enjoyments for the sake of permanent
future happiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3374. Every large city is filled with persons, who, in order
to support the appearance of wealth, constantly live beyond
their income, and make up the deficiency by contracting debts
which are never paid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3375. Others there are, the mere drones of society, who pass
their days in idleness, and subsist by pirating on the hives of
the industrious.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3376. Many who run a short-lived career of splendid beggary,
could they but be persuaded to adopt a system of rigid
economy for a few years, might pass the remainder of their
days in affluence.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3377. But no! They must keep up <em>appearances</em>, they must
live like other folks.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3378. Their debts accumulate; their credit fails; they are
harassed by duns, and besieged by constables and sheriffs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3379. In this extremity, as a last resort, they submit to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
shameful dependence, or engage in criminal practices, which
entail hopeless wretchedness and infamy on themselves and
families.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3380. Stick to the business in which you are regularly
employed. Let speculators make their thousands in a year
or a day; mind your own regular trade, never turning from it
to the right hand or to the left.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3381. If you are a merchant, a professional man, or a
mechanic, never buy lots or stocks unless you have surplus
money which you wish to invest. Your own business you
understand as well as other men; but other people's business
you do not understand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3382. Let your business be some one which is useful to the
community. All such occupations possess the elements of
profit in themselves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3383. To the foregoing advice we add the description of <em>the
hero in business life</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3384. A sacred regard to the principles of justice forms the
basis of every transaction, and regulates the conduct of the upright
man of business.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3385. He is strict in keeping his engagements.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3386. Does nothing carelessly or in a hurry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3387. Employs nobody to do what he can easily do himself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3388. Keeps every thing in its proper place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3389. Leaves nothing undone that ought to be done, and
which circumstances permit him to do.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3390. Keeps his designs and business from the view of
others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3391. Is prompt and decisive with his customers, and does
not overtrade his capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3392. Prefers short credits to long ones; and cash to credit
at all times, either in buying or selling; and small profits in
credit cases with little risk, to the chance of better gains with
more hazard.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3393. He is clear and explicit in all his bargains.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3394. Leaves nothing of consequence to memory which he
can and ought to commit to writing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3395. Keeps copies of all his important letters which he
sends away, and has every letter, invoice, &amp;c., relating to his
business, titled, classed, and put away.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3396. Never suffers his desk to be confused by many papers
lying upon it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3397. Is always at the head of his business, well knowing
that if he leaves it, it will leave him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3398. Holds it as a maxim that he whose credit is suspected
is not one to be trusted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3399. Is constantly examining his books, and sees through
all his affairs as far as care and attention will enable him.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3400. Balances regularly at stated times, and then makes
out and transmits all his accounts-current to his customers,
both at home and abroad.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3401. He avoids, as much as possible, all sorts of accommodation
in money matters and lawsuits where there is the least
hazard.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3402. He is economical in his expenditure, always living
within his income.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3403. Keeps a memorandum-book in his pocket, in which
he notes every particular relative to appointments, addresses,
and petty cash matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3404. Is cautious how he becomes security for any person;
and is generous when urged by motives of humanity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3405. Let a man act strictly to these habits; when once
begun they will be easy to continue in&mdash;ever remembering
that he hath no profits by his pains whom Providence doth
not prosper&mdash;and success will attend his efforts.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3406. If he has a good wife, who does her part, the happiness
of the noble-hearted business-man is as secure as humanity
admits.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>TEMPERANCE.</h4>

<p>3407. To "be temperate in all things," is the command; a
rule necessary for men in order to acquire wealth righteously,
and enjoy health perfectly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3408. Late hours, irregular habits, and want of attention
to diet, are common errors with most young men, and these
gradually, but at first imperceptibly, undermine the health,
and lay the foundation for various forms of disease in after
life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3409. It is a very difficult thing to make young persons
comprehend this. They frequently sit up as late as twelve,
one, or two o'clock, without experiencing any ill effects; they
go without a meal to-day, and to-morrow eat to repletion, with
only temporary inconvenience.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3410. One night they will sleep three or four hours, and the
next nine or ten; or one night, in their eagerness to get away
into some agreeable company, they will take no food at all;
and the next, perhaps, will eat a hearty supper, and go to bed
upon it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3411. These, with various other irregularities, are common
to the majority of young men, and are, as just stated, the cause
of much bad health in mature life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3412. Indeed, nearly all the shattered constitutions with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
which too many are cursed, are the result of a disregard to the
plainest precepts of health in early life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3413. Laborers, and other working people, more especially
those whose occupations require them to be much in the open
air, may be considered as following a regulated system of moderation;
and hence the higher degree of health which prevails
among them and their families.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3414. They also observe rules; and those which it is said
were recommended by Old Parr are remarkable for good sense;
namely&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3415. "Keep your head cool by temperance, your feet
warm by exercise; rise early, and go soon to bed; and if you
are inclined to get fat, keep your eyes open and your mouth
shut."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3416. In other words, sleep moderately, and be abstemious
in diet;&mdash;excellent admonitions, more especially to those
inclined to corpulency.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3417. The advantage to be derived from a regular mode of
living, with a view to the preservation of health and life, are
nowhere better exemplified than in the precepts and practice
of Plutarch, whose rules for this purpose are excellent; and
by observing them himself, he maintained his bodily strength
and mental faculties unimpaired to a very advanced age.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3418. Galen is a still stronger proof of the advantages of
a regular plan, by means of which he reached the great age
of 140 years, without having ever experienced disease.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3419. His advice to the readers of his "Treatise on Health,"
is as follows:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3420. "I beseech all persons who shall read this work, not
to degrade themselves to a level with the brutes, or the rabble,
by gratifying their sloth, or by eating and drinking promiscuously
whatever pleases their palates, or by indulging
their appetites of every kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3421. "But, whether they understand physic, or not, let them
consult their reason, and observe what agrees, and what does
not agree with them, that, like wise men, they may adhere to
the use of such things as conduce to their health, and forbear
every thing which, by their own experience, they find to do
them hurt; and let them be assured that, by a diligent observation
and practice of this rule, they may enjoy a good share
of health, and seldom stand in need of physic or physicians."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3422. The celebrated maxims of Dr. Franklin, published as
the "Sayings of Poor Richard," deserve a place in this family
book.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3423. I have sought out, and here bring together, over one
hundred of these prudent precepts.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>THE WAY TO WEALTH.</h4>

<p>3424. God helps those who help themselves.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3425. Many words won't fill a bushel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3426. Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor wears.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3427. The key often used is always bright.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3428. Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for
that is the stuff life is made of.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3429. The sleeping fox catches no poultry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3430. There will be time enough for sleep, in the grave.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3431. If time be of all things the most precious, wasting
time must be the greatest prodigality.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3432. Lost time is never found again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3433. What we call time enough, always proves little enough.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3434. Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry all easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3435. He that riseth late must trot all day, and shall scarce
overtake his business at night.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3436. Laziness travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes
him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3437. Drive thy business, lest it drive thee.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3438. Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy,
wealthy, and wise.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3439. Industry need not wish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3440. He that lives upon hope, will die fasting.</p>

<h3>THE FAMILY AT HOME.</h3>

of Washington.</em></p>


<p>3535. A good table is necessary to health and domestic
comfort.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3536. Nearly every family in our Republic has, or might have,
the means of living very comfortably; if nothing was wasted,
and all food was properly cooked, good tables would abound.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3537. In my "New Cook Book" these subjects are so fully
treated that little can be added.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3538. Still a few "Choice Receipts" on Cookery will be
found in this volume, at page <a href="#Page_319">319</a> and on. I shall add such
other directions in this chapter as seem necessary to complete
the system: and first of the staff of life&mdash;<em>bread.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3539. <em>Bread.</em>&mdash;To make good bread, or to understand the
process of making it, is the duty of every woman; indeed, an
art that should never be neglected in the education of a <span class="smcap">lady</span>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3540. <em>The Lady</em> derives her title from "dividing or distributing
bread:" the more perfect the bread the more noble the
lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3541. In "Mrs. Hale's New Cook Book," and in the following
directions, the art is made plain; and the process may,
by practice, be easily acquired.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3542. <em>Proportions of Nutriment in articles of Food.</em>&mdash;See
"Mrs. Hale's New Cook Book&mdash;Introductory," etc.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3543. <em>Bread</em> contains eighty nutritious parts in one hundred;
meal thirty-four in one hundred; French beans, ninety-two
in one hundred; common beans, eighty-nine in one hundred;
peas, ninety-three in one hundred; lentils, ninety-four
in one hundred; cabbages and turnips, the most aqueous of
all the vegetables compared, produce only eight pounds of solid
matter in one hundred pounds; carrots and spinach produce
fourteen in the same quantity; while one hundred pounds of
potatoes contain twenty-five pounds of dry substance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3544. From a general estimate it results, that one pound
of good bread is equal to two pounds and a half or three
pounds of potatoes; that seventy-five pounds of bread and
thirty of meat may be substituted for three hundred pounds
of potatoes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3545. The other substances bear the following proportions:
four parts of cabbage to one of potatoes; three parts of turnips
to one of potatoes; two parts of carrots and spinach to one
of potatoes; and about three parts and a half of potatoes to
one of rice, lentils, beans, French beans, and dry peas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3546. <em>To test flour</em>, people in the trade generally knead a
small quantity by way of experiment; if good, the flour immediately
forms an adhesive elastic paste, which will readily
assume any form that may be given to it, without danger of
breaking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3547. Pure and unadulterated flour may likewise be easily
distinguished by other methods: seize a handful briskly, and
squeeze it half a minute; it preserves the form of the cavity of
the hand in one piece, although it may be rudely placed on
the table; not so that which contains foreign substances, it
breaks in pieces more or less; that mixed with whiting being the
most adhesive, but still dividing and falling down in a little time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3548. <em>Indian Bread.</em>&mdash;One quart of buttermilk, one quart
of Indian-meal, one quart of coarse flour, one cup of molasses;
add a little soda and salt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3549. <em>Bread making</em> is an art, the importance of which is
too frequently overlooked or underrated. Heavy, sour, hard
bread should never be tolerated, because good bread is more
palatable, more healthy, and it should be borne in mind, is really
much less expensive. There is great saving in baking bread
at home, and this saving is greatest when flour is cheapest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3550. <em>Good flour</em> and good yeast are requisites, but the
goodness of the bread depends much on the kneading: the
more the dough is turned and pressed and worked, the lighter
and better the bread will be.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3551. <em>Proportions.</em>&mdash;Two gallons flour, half pint strong
fresh yeast; if home-made, add more.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3552. <em>The Process.</em>&mdash;Make a hole in the flour, in which
pour the yeast mixed with half a pint warm water. Stir in
the flour round the edge of this liquid with a spoon to form a
thin batter. After stirring it well for two minutes, sprinkle a
handful of flour over the top of this batter, lay a warm cloth
over it, and set it to rise in a warm place. When it rises so
as to crack on the top add four spoonsful fine salt, and begin
to form the mass into dough, pouring as much soft, lukewarm
water as is necessary to make the flour mix with the
batter. When the flour and batter are thoroughly mixed,
knead and work the whole till it is light and stiff. Roll into
a lump, sprinkle dry flour over it, cover and put into a warm
place, when in half an hour it will rise enough for baking.
See "Mrs. Hale's Cook Book," page 375. <em>The quality</em> depends
much on the time of putting the dough in the oven.
Dough readily runs into three stages of fermentation. It
should be put in the oven during the first or <em>saccharine</em>, when
if sufficiently baked it will be sweet and wholesome. It afterward
becomes sour and heavy. If put in too soon, it will be
light and as tasteless as saw-dust.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3553. <em>Good bread</em> is marked by fine pores and a sort of
network of uniform appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3554. <em>Keep bread</em> wrapped in a coarse towel, and where it
will not dry up, or in a tight box.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3555. <em>If sour</em>, from being mixed over night, melt a teaspoon
of pearlash in a little milk-warm water, sprinkle it over
the dough, and in half an hour knead it again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3556. <em>Frozen</em> dough is spoiled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3557. <em>Indian</em> is a good addition to wheat, and requires
more water, or make mush of it and then mix in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3558. <em>The bitterness</em> of yeast may be remedied by putting
in a little charcoal and then straining it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3559. <em>Rye and Indian Bread.</em>&mdash;Mix two quarts of each
with three pints boiling milk, table-spoon salt, and stir well.
Let it stand till lukewarm, then stir in half pint good yeast.
Knead to a stiff dough and put to rise near the fire. When
the top is cracked over, make into two loaves and bake
moderate two and a half hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3560. <em>Common Yeast.</em>&mdash;Boil a large handful hops in two
quarts of water twenty minutes. Strain and pour the liquid
into three pints flour. Stir in half a pint strong yeast. Its
strength is increased by five tea-spoons brown sugar or five
large spoons molasses. Cork the bottles loose till next day,
and then tight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3561. <em>If turning sour</em> put tea-spoon pearlash in each
bottle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3562. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Boil, peel and mash mealy potatoes, which
reduce with water or ale as thin as common yeast. To every
pound add two ounces coarse sugar, and when just warm stir
in two spoons of yeast. Keep warm till fermentation is over
and in twenty-four hours fit for use. Let sponge eight hours
before baking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3563. <em>Yeast.</em>&mdash;Boil one pound of good flour, a quarter of a
pound of brown sugar, and a little salt, in two gallons of water
for one hour. When milk-warm, bottle it close; it will be fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
to use in twenty-four hours. One pint of this will make
eighteen pounds of bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3564. <em>Pulled Bread.</em>&mdash;Take from the oven an ordinary loaf
when it is about <em>half baked</em>, and with the fingers, while the
bread is yet hot, dexterously pull the half-set dough into
pieces of irregular shape, about the size of an egg. Don't
attempt to smooth or flatten them&mdash;the rougher their shapes
the better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3565. Set upon tins, place in a very slow oven, and bake
to a rich brown. This forms a deliciously crisp crust for
cheese. If you do not bake at home, your baker will prepare
it for you, if ordered. Pulled bread may be made in the revolving
ovens.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3566. It is very nice with wine instead of biscuits.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3567. <em>A great increase on home-made bread</em>, even equal to
one-fifth, may be produced by using bran water for kneading
the dough. The proportion is three pounds of bran for every
twenty-eight pounds of flour, the bran to be boiled for an
hour, and then strained through a hair-sieve.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3568. Indian cake made with buttermilk, or sour milk with
a little cream or butter rubbed into the meal, and a tea-spoonful
of pearlash in the milk, is very light and nutritious.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3569. <em>Use of Lime-water in making Bread.</em>&mdash;It has lately
been found that water saturated with lime produces in bread
the same whiteness, softness and capacity of retaining moisture,
as results from the use of alum; while the former removes all
acidity from the dough, and supplies an ingredient needed in
the structure of the bones, but which is deficient in the
<em>cerealia</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3570. The best proportion to use is, five pounds of water
saturated with lime, to every nineteen pounds of flour. No
change is required in the process of baking.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3571. The lime most effectually coagulates the gluten, and
the bread weighs well; bakers must therefore approve of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
introduction, which is not injurious to the system, like
alum, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3572. <em>Cheap Bread.</em>&mdash;Indian meal is the cheapest, and a
bushel furnishes more nutriment than the same quantity of
wheat. It is also a generally healthy diet, and those who
wish to practice close economy should use much of this meal
in their families.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3573. It makes excellent puddings and warm cakes, which
are much less apt to oppress the stomach than hot wheat bread
or short cakes of any kind. And good, light, nourishing
bread may be made by using five parts of Indian and one of
rye or wheat flour, (see receipts for "Rye and Indian
Bread;") which is better than to cook it hot at every meal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3574. Remember that <em>four</em> loaves of <em>cold bread</em> will go as
far in a family as <em>five loaves of hot bread</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3575. <em>Excellent paste</em> for fruit or meat pies may be made
with two-thirds of wheat flour, one-third of the flour of boiled
potatoes, and some butter or dripping; the whole being
brought to a proper consistence with warm water, and a small
quantity of yeast added when lightness is desired. This will
also make very pleasant cakes for breakfast, and may be made
with or without spices, fruit, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3576. <em>Picnic Biscuits.</em>&mdash;Take two ounces of fresh butter,
and well work it with a pound of flour. Mix thoroughly with
it half a salt-spoonful of pure carbonate of soda; two ounces
of sugar; mingle thoroughly with the flour; make up the
paste with spoonfuls of milk&mdash;it will require scarcely a quarter
of a pint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3577. Knead smooth, roll a quarter of an inch thick, cut in
rounds about the size of the top of a small wine-glass; roll
these out thin, prick them well, lay them on lightly floured
tins, and bake in a gentle oven until crisp. When cold put
into dry canisters.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3578. Thin cream used instead of milk, in the paste, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
enrich the biscuits. Caraway seeds or ginger can be added,
to vary these at pleasure.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3579. <em>Rye and wheat flour</em>, half and half, makes excellent
household bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3580. <em>Common Black Cake.</em>&mdash;Beat separately the whites
and yolks of three eggs. Mix half a pound of butter with one
pound of flour; one tumbler of milk; one tumbler of molasses;
one pound of sugar. Then put in the eggs and one and one-half
teaspoonful of soda. Wine, currants, raisins and citron
to your taste.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3581. <em>Maize Cake.</em>&mdash;Take six eggs, a paper of Oswego corn
starch, one pound of loaf sugar, half pound of butter, half
teacup of milk, half a teaspoon of soda, one teaspoon of cream
of tartar, the grated rind of the lemon; dissolve the soda in
half the milk, and add it the last thing. Bake in an oven as
quick as you can make it, without burning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3582. It is a very delicate cake to bake well. Use flat pans,
a little deeper than Spanish bun pans, and put paper over the
top.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Item number '3583.' missing">3583.</span> <em>Composition Cake.</em>&mdash;Take three pounds of flour, half pound
of butter, one and three-quarter pounds of sugar, three eggs&mdash;beat
the eggs&mdash;add half a pint of yeast to them, half a pint
of new milk, three spoonsful of rose-water, and a little cinnamon
and cloves; put the butter in the flour and half the sugar,
the other half mix with the eggs; make a hole in the flour,
pour the ingredients into it; set it to lighten in the morning
by the fire; after it is made out into rolls, you may put it into
tins, and set it before the fire for an hour or two; when sufficiently
risen, bake it in rather a slow oven.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3584. <em>Ginger Biscuits and Cakes.</em>&mdash;Work into small crumbs
three ounces of butter, two pounds of flour; add three ounces
of powdered sugar and two of ginger, in fine powder; knead
into a stiff paste, with new milk, roll thin, cut out with a
cutter; bake in a slow oven until crisp through; keep of a pale
color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3585. Additional sugar may be used when sweeter biscuit
is desired. For good ginger-cakes, butter six ounces, sugar
eight, for each pound of flour; wet the ingredients into a paste
with eggs; a little lemon-grate will give an agreeable flavor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3586. <em>Loaf-cake.</em>&mdash;Six pounds of flour, three and one-half
pounds of butter, three and one-half pounds of sugar, three
pints of milk, six eggs, four pounds of fruit, one-half pint of
yeast, three gills of wine, four nutmegs, and one and one-quarter
ounce of mace citron. Stir butter and sugar to a
froth; boil the milk, and turn in the wine; put the curds and
whey <em>warm</em>, but not <em>hot</em>, into the flour; then add the eggs and
yeast, and only one-third of the beaten butter and sugar; let
it rise until very light, and then add the remainder of the
butter and sugar, and let it rise <em>again</em>; when light, put in the
spices, fruit, &amp;c., bake it in a <em>not</em> very hot oven.</p>

<p>Another receipt leaves out one-half pound of butter and
also one-half pound of sugar to the same quantity of flour,
fruit, eggs, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3587. <em>Sponge-Cake.</em>&mdash;Take three-quarters of a pound of
white sugar, and pour one-half tumbler of cold water into
it, and set it over the fire until it <em>boils clear</em>; beat up seven
eggs, the whites and yolks separately, and, after the sugar and
water has cooled, add the yolks, stirring them well; flavor it
with the peel of a lemon, and half the juice of the same; add
the whites of the eggs, and then sift in one half pound of
flour. This cake has the advantage of remaining moist and
spirited, longer than other sponge-cake.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3588. <em>A Cheap and Quick Pudding.</em>&mdash;Beat up four eggs, add
a pint of milk and a little salt, and stir in four large spoonsful
of flour, a little nutmeg and sugar to your taste. Beat it well,
and pour it into buttered teacups, filling them rather more
than half full. They will bake in a stove or Dutch oven in
fifteen minutes; and if you have company to dinner, and wish
to add a little dish, this is a good and cheap one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3589. <em>Sago and Apple Pudding</em> (very nice).&mdash;Let half a
pound of sago steep in water enough to cover it until dissolved.
This will take about half an hour. Pare and core eight nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
apples without cutting them apart. Fill the middle with sugar,
putting in each a little cinnamon. Arrange the apples in a
pudding-dish, and pour over them the sago. Let it bake from
one to two hours. This is equally as nice, although it does not
look so well, if the apples are cut in quarters instead of being
left whole, and the sugar and cinnamon sprinkled over them.
It is good either cold or hot.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3590. <em>Pea Pudding.</em>&mdash;Dry a pint or quart of split peas
thoroughly before the fire; then tie them up loosely in a cloth,
put them into warm water, boil them a couple of hours, or
more, until quite tender; take them up, beat them well in
a dish with a little salt (some add the yolk of an egg) and a
bit of butter. Make it quite smooth, tie it up again in a cloth,
and boil it an hour longer. This is highly nourishing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3591. <em>Calves' Feet Jelly.</em>&mdash;Boil four feet in four gallons of
water till it comes to half a gallon; strain it, let it stand till
cold, and skim off all the fat clean. Take the jelly up, leaving
the settlings at the bottom. Put your jelly into a clean saucepan
or skillet, and to every quart of jelly add one pint of wine,
half pound of loaf-sugar beaten, the juice of a large lemon;
beat up the whites of three eggs to a froth&mdash;put all in together&mdash;stir
well till it boils, let it boil a few minutes, have
ready a double flannel bag, pour it in again till it runs clear;
have a china bowl with lemon-peel cut as thin as possible, let
the jelly drip on the peel and it will give it a flavor, and a fine
amber color; with a clean silver spoon fill your glasses.&mdash;(See
"Mrs. Hale's Cook Book," p. 324.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3592. <em>Calves' Feet Jelly made with Gelatine.</em>&mdash;Take three
quarts of water, one pint of white wine, six table-spoonsful
of brandy; six lemons, peel and all; six eggs, the whites
slightly beaten, the shells crushed, and the yolks not used;
three pounds of white sugar, four ounces of gelatine. Soak
for half an hour the gelatine in one quart of the water. Mix
the other ingredients in the other two quarts. Put all together,
and let them boil twenty minutes without stirring. Strain it
through a flannel bag without squeezing. Wet the mould in
cold water. Pour the jelly in, and leave it to cool. Three
hours is generally sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3593. <em>Meats.</em>&mdash;A few hints, or general rules will be given
here. (See "Mrs. Hale's New Cook Book" for Receipts, &amp;c.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3594. <em>Animal food.</em>&mdash;The quantity of animal food required
to sustain the constitution, in its most perfect state, is greatest
in the coldest countries, and, decreasing according to the
warmth of the climate, when we reach the torrid zone, but a
small quantity is needed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3595. In temperate climates, like our own, the largest
quantity is required during the winter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3596. None should use it freely during the hottest weather,
except it be those who labor hard in the open air; it rarely
appears to injure such, yet probably it would be best for them
to eat less meat and more bread and vegetables during summer.
They would not then suffer so much from thirst, which
often induces the desire for stimulating liquids.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3597. As a general rule, animal food is more easily and
speedily digested than vegetable food of any kind&mdash;and this
it is which makes meats more heating and stimulating.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3598. The great essentials for the easy digestion of animal
food are that the fibres be tender and fine grained.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3599. Of the different sorts of butcher meat, <em>Pork</em> is that
of which the least quantity should be taken at a time. It requires
longer to digest roasted pork than any other kind of
meat.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3600. Beef agrees well with most constitutions; it is
cheapest in the autumn, but best in the winter season. Many
have a distaste to mutton; but for those who relish it, it is a
nutritious food, and easy of digestion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3601. Lamb, veal, and fowls are delicate and healthy diet
for the young and sedentary; and for all who find fat meats
and those of coarse fibre do not agree with them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3602. The most economical way of cooking meat is to <em>boil</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
it, if the liquid be used for soup or broth, as it always ought
to be.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3603. Baking is one of the cheapest ways of dressing a
dinner in small families, and several kinds of meat are excellent
done in this way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3604. Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, and fillets of
veal will bake to much advantage; especially if they be fat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3605. Never bake a lean, thin piece, it will all shrivel
away. Such pieces should always be boiled or made into
soup.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3606. Pigs, geese, and the buttock of beef are all excellent
baked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3607. Meat always loses in weight by being cooked.&mdash;In
roasting, the loss is the greatest. It also costs more in fuel
to roast than to boil&mdash;still there are many pieces of meat
which seem made for roasting; and it would be almost wrong
to cook them in any other way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3608. The other pieces of the animal are best salted and
boiled; or if used fresh, stewed or in soups. Beef should
rarely be fried.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3609. <em>Roasting beef.</em>&mdash;Ten pounds of beef require from two
hours to two hours and a-half roasting, eighteen inches from a
good clear fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3610. Six pounds require one hour and a-quarter to one
hour and a-half, fourteen inches from a good clear fire.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3611. Three ribs of beef, boned and rolled, tied round with
paper, will require two hours and a-half, eighteen inches from
the fire; baste once only.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3612. The first three ribs of fifteen or twenty pounds, will
take three hours or three and a-half; the fourth and fifth ribs
will take as long, managed in the same way as the sirloin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
Paper the fat and the thin part, or it will be done too much
before the thick part is done enough.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3613. When beef is very fat, it does not require basting;
if very lean tie it up in buttered paper, and baste frequently
and well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3614. Common cooks are generally fond of too fierce a fire,
and of putting things too near to it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3615. Slow roasting is as advantageous to the tenderness
and flavor of meat as slow boiling.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3616. The warmer the weather, and the staler killed the
meat is, the less time it will require to roast it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3617. Meat that is very fat requires more time than other
meat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3618. <em>Cooking meats.</em>&mdash;The proper manner of preparation
is, to cook it till it is entirely <em>separated from the blood</em>, and
the fibres are rendered soft and easy of digestion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3619. Lamb is a delicate and tender meat; but it requires
to be kept a few days, when the weather will permit&mdash;and
should be thoroughly cooked to be healthful. Never take
lamb or veal from the spit till the gravy that drops is white.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3620. <em>Preserving meats.</em>&mdash;Salt is the grand preservative of
meats; but in using these, care should be taken to soak them
if too salt. It is not healthy to eat our food very salt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3621. In the summer season, particular attention must be
observed, lest fresh meat be injured. In the country this care
is very necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3622. Be sure to take the kernels out of a round of beef;
one in the udder, in the fat, and those about the thick end of
the flank.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3623. To salt the meat thoroughly, rub in the salt evenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
into every part, and fill the holes where the kernels were taken
out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3624. A pound and a-half of salt will be sufficient for
twenty-five pounds of beef, if you only want to corn it to be
eaten in a few days.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3625. In the summer, the sooner meat is salted, after it is
cool, the better. In winter, it is better to be kept a few days
before salting.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3626. Pork ought not to be allowed to freeze before it is
salted for family use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3627. If you wish beef to look red, rub it first with saltpetre
and sugar; half an ounce of each mixed together, is
sufficient for twenty pounds of meat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3628. <em>Poultry.</em>&mdash;No kind of animal food is so delicate and
delicious as the flesh of fowls and birds, and no kind is so
generally healthful. Rarely does it disagree with those who
are well; even the feeble in constitution, or those debilitated
by sickness, find this a most agreeable and nutritious diet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3629. The white meat of a young turkey, when well boiled,
is easier of digestion than that of any other fowl.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3630. In a young turkey, the toes and bill are soft.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3631. A young goose (a very old one is not fit to be eaten)
is plump in the breast, and the fat white and soft&mdash;the feet
yellow, the web of the foot thin and tender.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3632. Ducks, if young, feel very tender under the wing,
and the web of the foot is transparent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3633. The best fowls have yellow legs&mdash;if very old, the feet
look stiff and worn.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3634. Pigeons should be quite fresh, the breast plump and
fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3635. Poultry should lie one night after being killed in
warm weather to make it tender; in cold weather it may be
kept a much longer time to advantage.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3636. Take care of the liquor you have boiled poultry or
meat in; in five minutes you may make it into soup.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3637. The good housewife never boils a joint without converting
the broth into some sort of soup.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3638. If the liquor be too salt, only use half the quantity,
and the rest water; wash salted meat well with cold water
before you put it into the boiler.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3639. Fish is much less nutritious than flesh. The white kinds
of fish, cod, haddock, flounders, white fish, &amp;c., are the least
nutritious; the oily kinds, salmon, eels, herrings, &amp;c., are
more difficult to digest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3640. Shell-fish have long held a high rank as restorative
food; but a well-dressed chop or steak is much better to recruit
the strength and spirits.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3641. <em>Hashes.</em>&mdash;All the pieces and bits of cold meat should
be minced and warmed; if this is rightly done, the dish is
generally a favorite one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3642. It is best to chop the meat very fine, (gristles and
gelatinous matter from the bones may be included;) then make
a gravy by putting a lump of butter (what you judge necessary)
into a stewpan; when it is hot, add a little flour, and
stir it into the butter; then add a teacupful of the broth the
meat was boiled in, and a little catsup. Let this boil up, then
put in the mince meat, with a little chopped parsley, pepper
and salt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3643. Let it stand and simmer a few minutes covered, but
do not let it boil&mdash;it hardens the meat to boil it. Lay slices
of toasted bread in the dish, and pour the meat and gravy
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3644. <em>Meat</em> may be kept several days in the height of summer,
sweet and good, by lightly covering it with bran, and
hanging it in some high or windy room, or in a passage
where there is a current of air.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>VEGETABLES.</h4>

<p>3645. The importance of using a portion of vegetable food
can hardly be overrated, though to make this our only diet
does and must prove injurious, because contrary to man's
nature and the arrangements of the Creator.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3646. The farinaceous (or mealy) are far more nutritious
than other vegetables; but none are sufficiently so to sustain
the constitution under the cares and labors necessary to the
full development of the energies of body and mind.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3647. And unless these can be developed and sustained,
the rational and moral character of the human race will never
be perfected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3648. Still, though animal food is never, except in peculiar
cases of disease, to be wholly abandoned, we must be quite as
scrupulous not to neglect the vegetable part of our diet. This
is necessary in order to prevent the concentrated diet of flesh
from too sudden and stimulating action.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3649. Besides, our nature demands a portion of vegetables
to keep the system in proper and healthy order. A <em>mixed
diet</em> is the only right regimen&mdash;the proportions of the different
kinds of food vary, with different ages and constitutions, in
different climates and seasons; still, in some degree, this rule
should never be abandoned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3650. The very young require a large portion of mild farinaceous
vegetables, such as rice, sago, tapioca, and potatoes;
the two first are very easy of digestion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3651. There are three things to be attended to in cooking
vegetables; make them sufficiently soft, develop their best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
flavor, and correct any rank or disagreeable taste they may
have.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3652. These things are very easily accomplished&mdash;boil them
sufficiently; change the water if they are rank or unpleasant,
and add a little salt, sugar or spice, as the case may require.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3653. Vegetables are always best when newly gathered,
except the potato; that is better in winter, if well kept.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3654. They are in greatest perfection when in greatest
plenty; that is, in their proper season.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3655. Except spinach, all vegetables should be boiled
quickly (soft water is much the best) in an open vessel, and
carefully skimmed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3656. <em>To Clear Vegetables of Insects.</em>&mdash;Make a strong
brine of one pound and a half of salt to one gallon of water,
into this place the vegetables with the stalk ends uppermost,
for two or three hours; this will destroy all the insects which
cluster in the leaves, and they will fall out and sink to the
bottom of the water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3657. <em>Potatoes.</em>&mdash;There are few articles in families more
subject to waste, both in paring, boiling, and being actually
thrown away, than potatoes; and there are few cooks but
what boil twice as many potatoes every day as are wanted; and
fewer still that do not throw the residue away as totally unfit
in any shape for the next day's meal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3658. Yet if they would take the trouble to beat up the despised
cold potatoes with an equal quantity of flour, they would
find them produce a much lighter dumpling or pudding than
they can make with flour alone; and by the aid of a few
spoonfuls of good gravy, they will provide a cheap and agreeable
appendage to the dinner table.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3659. <em>Bad Butter</em> may be improved greatly by dissolving it
thoroughly in hot water; let it cool, then skim it off, and
churn again, adding a little good salt and sugar. A small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
quantity can be tried and approved before doing a larger one.
The water should be merely hot enough to melt the butter or
it will become oily.&mdash;(See "Mrs. Hale's Cook Book.")</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3660. <em>Dinners.</em>&mdash;The appearance a dinner-table presents
does not depend so much upon a profuseness of viands, as
upon the neatness, cleanliness, and well-studied arrangement
of the whole. Taste, if well directed, may produce a handsome
dinner; whereas three times the amount of money may
be expended upon another, and yet not make even a respectable
appearance.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT.</h4>

<p>3661. Have you ever observed what a dislike servants have
to any thing cheap. They hate saving their master's money.
I tried this experiment with great success the other day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3662. Finding we consumed a vast deal of soap, I sat down
in my thinking chair, and took the soap question into consideration,
and found reason to suspect we were using a very
expensive article, where a much cheaper one would serve the
purpose better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3663. I ordered half a dozen pounds of both sorts, but
took the precaution of changing the papers on which the
prices were marked before giving them into the hands of Betty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3664. "Well, Betty, which soap do you find washes best?"</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3665. "Oh, please sir, the dearest, in the blue paper; it
makes a lather as well again as the other."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3666. "Well, Betty, you shall always have it then." And
thus the unsuspecting Betty saved me some pounds a-year, and
washed the clothes better.&mdash;<em>Rev. Sidney Smith.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3667. <em>Receipt for Obtaining Good Servants.</em>&mdash;Let them
observe in your conduct to others just the qualities and virtues
that you would desire they should possess and practice as
respects you. Be uniformly kind and gentle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3668. If you reprove, do so with reason and with temper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3669. Be respectable, and you will be respected by them.
Be kind, and you will meet kindness from them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3670. Consider their interests, and they will consider yours.
A friend in a servant is no contemptible thing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3671. Be to every servant a friend; and heartless, indeed,
will be the servant who does not warm in love to you.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3672. Four important rules:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3673. 1. A suitable place for everything, and every thing
in its place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3674. 2. A proper time for every thing, and every thing
done in its time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3675. 3. A distinct name for every thing, and every thing
called by its name.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3676. 4. A certain use for every thing, and every thing put
to its use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3677. <em>Oil-cloth</em> should never be scrubbed with a brush, but
after being first swept, it should be cleansed by washing with
a large soft cloth and lukewarm or cold water. On no account
use soap or hot water, as either will bring off the paint.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3678. <em>Straw Matting</em> may be cleaned with a large coarse
cloth dipped in salt and water, and then wiped dry: the salt
prevents the matting from turning yellow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3679. <em>Oil Paintings</em> hung over the mantle-piece are liable
to wrinkle with the heat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3680. <em>Ottomans and Sofas</em>, whether covered with cloth,
damask, or chintz, will look much the better for being cleaned
occasionally with bran and flannel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3681. <em>Furniture</em> made in the winter, and brought from a
cold warehouse into a warm apartment, is very liable to crack.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3682. <em>Rosewood furniture</em> should be rubbed gently every
day with a clean soft cloth, to keep it in order.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>BEVERAGES.</h4>

<p>3683. <em>Water</em>, pure, sweet, cool water is, undoubtedly, the
most healthful drink for thirst.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3684. <em>Bad water</em> should be filtered.&mdash;(See pages <a href="#Page_42">42</a>, <a href="#Page_43">43</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3685. <em>Tea and coffee</em> are the best and least hurtful stimulants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3686. Liebig, with his chemical discoveries, demonstrates
that they have become necessaries of life to all nations; that
they were both originally met with amongst nations whose diet
is chiefly vegetable; and by contributing to the formation of
bile, their peculiar functions have become a substitute for
animal food to a large class of the population whose consumption
of meat is very limited, and to another large class who
are unable to take regular exercise.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3687. <em>In making coffee</em>, observe that the broader the bottom
and the smaller the top of the vessel, the better it will be.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3688. <em>Substitute for Cream in Tea or Coffee.</em>&mdash;Beat the
white of an egg to a froth, put to it a very small lump of
butter, and mix well. Then turn into it gradually, so that it
may not curdle. If perfectly done, it will be an excellent substitute
for cream.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_352">352</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3689. <em>Iceland Moss Chocolate&mdash;For the Sick Room.</em>&mdash;Iceland
moss has been in the highest repute on the continent as
a most efficacious remedy in incipient pulmonary complaints;
combined with <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'chocalate'">chocolate</span> it will be found a nutritious article
of diet, and may be taken as a morning and evening beverage.
<em>Directions</em>&mdash;Mix a teaspoonful of the chocolate with a tea-spoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
of boiling water or milk, stirring constantly until it
is completely dissolved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3690. It is not easy to persuade laboring men that <em>water</em> is
the best beverage. Where the <em>water is bad</em>, some corrective
or palliative will be had. Then home-brewed <em>beer</em> is to be
commended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3691. <em>Beer and Beverages.</em>&mdash;(See "Mrs. Hale's New Cook
Book," page 397.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3692. <em>To restore a Barrel of Stale or Sour Beer.</em>&mdash;Put a
quarter of a pound of good hops, and two pounds of sound chalk
into the bung-hole, stop it close, and in a few days it will be
fit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3693. Or, a small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda may be
mixed with each quart as it is used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3694. <em>To give New Beer the flavor of Old.</em>&mdash;Take out the
bung, and put into the cask a handful of pickled cucumbers,
or a sliced Seville orange. Either mode will add an apparent
six months to the age of the beer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3695. <em>Common Beer.</em>&mdash;Two gallons of water, a large handful
of hops, fresh gathered spruce or sweet fern, and one quart
of wheat bran; boil two or three hours, strain and stir in,
while hot, two cups of molasses. When lukewarm, pour into a
clean barrel, and add a pint of yeast. Shake it well together,
and use next day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3696. <em>To give Beer a rich Flavor.</em>&mdash;Put six sea-biscuits
into a bag of hops, and put them in the cask.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3697. <em>Table Beer, cheap and wholesome.</em>&mdash;Eight bottles of
water, one quart of molasses, one pint of yeast, one tablespoon
of cream of tartar, mixed and bottled in twenty-four hours.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3698. <em>Table Beer from Sugar.</em>&mdash;To four pounds of coarse
brown sugar add ten gallons of water and three ounces of
hops. Let the whole boil three-quarters of an hour, and then
work it as usual. It should stand a week or ten days before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
being drawn, and will improve daily afterward for a moderate
time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3699. <em>Treacle Beer.</em>&mdash;Take a pound and a half of hops,
and boil in thirty-six gallons of water for an hour, then add
fourteen pounds of treacle, and a little yeast to work it; ferment,
and bottle.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3700. <em>Summer Drinks.</em>&mdash;Ice may be used in all these
beverages.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3701. <em>Tamarind Drink.</em>&mdash;Boil three pints of water with an
ounce and a half of tamarinds, three ounces of currants, and
two ounces of stoned raisins, till about a third has evaporated.
Strain, add a bit of lemon-peel, which is to be removed in
half an hour, then cool.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3702. <em>Sangaree.</em>&mdash;Mix a bottle of Marsala wine with a
bottle and a half of iced water, sweeten with loaf sugar, and
flavor with lemon-juice and grated nutmeg.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3703. <em>Curds and Whey</em> (cheap method).&mdash;Add six grains
of citric acid to a wine-glassful of milk, and the result will be
a pleasant acidulous whey, and a fine curd.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3704. <em>Currant Water.</em>&mdash;Take a pound of currants, and
squeeze into a quart of water; put in four or five ounces of
pounded sugar. Mix well, strain, and ice, or allow to get
cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3705. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eau Sucré.</i>&mdash;Dissolve sugar in boiling water, and
drink cold.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3706. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lait Sucré.</i>&mdash;Boil a pint of milk, sweeten with white
sugar, and flavor with lemon.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3707. <em>Effervescing Lemonade.</em>&mdash;Boil two pounds of white
sugar with a pint of lemon-juice, bottle and cork. Put a tablespoonful
of the syrup into a tumbler about three parts full of
cold water, add twenty grains of carbonate of soda and drink
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3708. <em>Quince Syrup.</em>&mdash;Grate quinces, pass the pulp through
a sieve, then set before the fire for the juice to settle and clarify;
strain, and add a pound of sugar (boiled down) to every
four ounces of juice; remove from the fire, and when cold,
bottle for use. A tablespoonful of this syrup will flavor a
pint of water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3709. <em>Effervescing Saline Draughts.</em>&mdash;White sugar powdered
eight ounces, tartaric acid two ounces, sesquicarbonate
of soda two ounces, essence of lemon a few drops. Mix well
and keep in a corked bottle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3710. <em>Summer Champagne.</em>&mdash;To four parts of selter water
add one of Moselle wine (or hock), and put a teaspoonful of
powdered sugar into a wine-glassful of this mixture; an ebullition
takes place, and you have a sort of champagne which is
more wholesome in hot weather than the genuine wine known
by that name.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3711. <em>An excellent Spring Beverage.</em>&mdash;The yolk of eggs
beaten up, lump sugar (<em>quantum sufficit</em>), Rhenish wine or
not, citric acid, powdered, or tartaric acid (small quantity,
exact quantity soon found); one or two drops of essence of
lemon on a lump of sugar, to make it mix readily with the
water; one quart of water. This is really an excellent, agreeable,
and, without the wine, an inexpensive beverage. <em>Good
for bilious complaints.</em></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>USEFUL RECEIPTS FOR FAMILY PRACTICE.</h4>

<p>3712. <em>Prevention of Baldness.</em>&mdash;Eau de Cologne two ounces,
tincture of cantharides two drachms, oil of rosemary, oil of
nutmeg, and oil of lavender, each ten drops. To be rubbed
on the bald part of the head every night.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3713. <em>Cramp in Bathing.</em>&mdash;For the cure of the cramp when
swimming, Dr. Franklin recommends a vigorous and violent
shock to the part affected, by suddenly and forcibly stretching
out the leg, which should be darted out of the water into the
air if possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3714. <em>Biting the Nails.</em>&mdash;This is a habit that should be immediately
corrected in children, as, if persisted in for any
length of time, it permanently deforms the nails.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3715. Dipping the finger-ends in some bitter tincture will
generally prevent children from putting them to the mouth;
but if this fails, as it sometimes will, each finger-end ought to
be encased in a finger-stall until the propensity is eradicated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3716. <em>Flour of Brimstone</em> is a mild aperient in doses of
about a quarter of an ounce; it is best taken in milk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3717. <em>To Fill a Decayed Tooth.</em>&mdash;Procure a small piece of
gutta percha, drop it into boiling water, then, with the thumb
and finger, take off as much as you suppose will fill up the
tooth nearly level, and while in this soft state press it into the
tooth; then hold on that side of the mouth cold water two or
three times, which will harden it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3718. <em>Cod-liver oil.</em>&mdash;Cod-liver oil is neither more nor less
than cod-oil clarified; and consequently two-thirds of its
medicinal qualities are abstracted thereby.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3719. <em>Cod oil</em> can be purchased pure at any wholesale oil
warehouse, at about one-thirtieth part of the price charged for
the so-called cod-liver oil. Many persons who have used cod-oil
pure as imported, have found it to answer much better than
the cod-liver oil purchased of a druggist.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3720. The best vehicle for taking cod-liver oil in, is new
milk; and the disagreeable flavor of the drug can easily be
covered by the addition of one drachm of orange peel to every
eight ounces of the oil.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3721. <em>To prevent Lockjaw, from a Nail run into the Foot, or
any other injury.</em>&mdash;Pour some turpentine into a tin cup and
hold it over a lighted candle or the fire until it boils. It boils
at so low a temperature that it will not burn when applied to
the skin. Make a swab by wrapping soft muslin or linen
round a stick. Dip this in the turpentine and apply it to the
wound, rubbing it in carefully for some time. Apply it as
warm as can be borne.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_375">375</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3722. <em>Squinting.</em>&mdash;Squinting frequently arises from the unequal
strength of the eyes, the weaker eye being turned away
from the object, to avoid the fatigue of exertion. Cases of
squinting of long standing have often been cured by covering
the stronger eye, and thereby compelling the weaker one to
exertion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3723. It is often a question amongst people who are unacquainted
with the anatomy and physiology of man, whether
lying with his head exalted, or even with the body, is most
wholesome. Most, consulting their own ease on this point,
argue in favor of that which they prefer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3724. Now, although many delight in bolstering up their
heads at night and sleep soundly without injury, yet we declare
it to be a dangerous habit. The vessels through which blood
passes from the heart to the head, are always lessened in the
cavities when the head is resting in bed higher than the body,
therefore, in all diseases attended with fever, the head should
be pretty near on a level with the body; and people ought to
accustom themselves to sleep thus to avoid danger.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3725. <em>Dyeing the Hair.</em>&mdash;It may be stated once for all that
this practice is decidedly injurious. It may fail altogether in
producing the desired result; it is never unattended by a
certain amount of unpleasant circumstances, and frequently
with evil results.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3726. <em>In the first place</em>, the alteration of the abnormal
color, so far as the general aspect of the face is concerned, has
an effect the very reverse of that which was intended.
Every constituent part of man tends to make the human
machine one harmonious whole. The figure, the stature, the
skin, the hair, the gait, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3727. <em>Fair hair</em> is associated with a sanguineous and lymphatic
temperament, a fine and white skin, blue eyes, and a
soft and mild expression.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3728. <em>Black hair</em>, on the contrary, is generally connected
with a bilious habit of body, a muscular and nervous temperament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
a dark and yellowish skin, lively black eyes, and a bold,
proud air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3729. <em>Red hair</em> is associated with a peculiar constitution,
although closely approaching to the fair type. In this variety
the skin is transparent, fresh, and presents a peculiar limpidity,
which belongs exclusively to the color of hair mentioned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3730. <em>The Contrast.</em>&mdash;If, then, from the impression that red
hair is a disfigurement, it is dyed black, what relation can
exist between this new color and the soft blue eye, and a skin
so fine and so susceptible, that the sun's rays seem to penetrate
it, in the form of those lentiginous spots commonly called
freckles.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3731. Be at much pains to keep your children's feet dry
and warm. Don't bury their bodies in heavy flannels and
wools, and leave their knees and legs naked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3732. <em>For Nausea.</em>&mdash;Three drops of hartshorn in a wine-glass
of water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3733. <em>For Sick Headache.</em>&mdash;One teaspoonful of pulverized
charcoal and one-third of a teaspoonful of soda mixed in very
warm water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3734. <em>Decoction of Sarsaparilla.</em>&mdash;Take four ounces of the
root, slice it down, put the slices into four pints of water,
and simmer for four hours. Take out the sarsaparilla, and
beat it into a mash; put it into the liquor again, and boil
down to two pints, then strain and cool the liquor. Dose&mdash;a
wine-glassful three times a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3735. Use&mdash;to purify the blood after a course of mercury;
or indeed whenever any taint is given to the constitution,
vitiating the blood, and producing eruptive affections.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3736. <em>Cough Syrup.</em>&mdash;Steep for twelve hours or more a
teacupful of wild-cherry bark in a quart of water. Add sugar
enough to make it quite sweet and let it boil to a syrup.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3737. <em>Cough Syrup&mdash;Very Good.</em>&mdash;Take a large handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
of the herb hoarhound, and the same quantity of boneset.
Steep them in a quart of water till it is reduced to a pint.
Then strain the tea and mix with it a pint of syrup and a pint
of sugar. Let it simmer for three or four hours, skimming it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3738. <em>Cure for Pain in the Ear.</em>&mdash;Take a teaspoonful of
brown sugar, put it on a shovel or any thing that you can
place over hot coals of fire until it gets thick, dissolve it in
camphor, and drop it in the ear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3739. <em>Gingerbread Aperients.</em>&mdash;Gingerbread, made with
oatmeal or with barley flour, is a very agreeable aperient for
children. Beware of giving children medicines too frequently.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3740. <em>For Bowel Complaints.</em>&mdash;One tablespoonful of flour,
one ditto of brandy, one ditto of loaf sugar, mixed together.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3741. <em>Jaundice.</em>&mdash;One pennyworth of allspice, ditto of
flour of brimstone, ditto of turmeric; these to be well pounded
together, and afterward to be mixed with half-a-pound of
molasses. Two table-spoonsful to be taken every day.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3742. <em>Night Sweats.</em>&mdash;Drink freely of cold sage tea; said
to be a certain remedy; or, take elixir of vitriol in a little
sweetened water. Dose from twenty to thirty drops.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS, RULES, ETC.</h4>

<p>3743. <em>To Cure a Soft Corn when between the Toes.</em>&mdash;A
small piece of cotton wool applied fresh every morning&mdash;gives
no inconvenience, is cleanly and efficacious. Castile Soap
placed between the toes is both cure and preventive of soft
corns.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3744. <em>Excellent Remedy for Lumbago.</em>&mdash;Dip a piece of
flannel in scalding water; wring it out, and sprinkle some turpentine
immediately over it, and apply it quickly to the part
affected by the pain. Repeat this process a few times, and it
will afford certain relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3745. <em>Burns and Scalds.</em>&mdash;Cold water is the readiest,
surest, most plentiful, and, for these reasons, the best remedy
for burns and scalds. Use it instantly, it will remove pain
and smarting; keep a cloth wet and <em>cold</em> upon the affected
part for five or six hours after the injury has occurred; a
blister will never rise, and the skin will be quite free from pain
afterward.&mdash;(See <a href="#Page_109">109</a>, <a href="#Page_110">110</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3746. <em>Scratches.</em>&mdash;Trifling as scratches often seem, they
ought never to be neglected, but should be covered and protected,
and kept clean and dry, until they have completely
healed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3747. If there is the least appearance of inflammation, no
time should be lost in applying a large bread and water poultice,
or hot flannels repeatedly applied.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3748. <em>Ringworm.</em>&mdash;The head to be washed twice a day with
soft soap and warm soft water; when dried, the places to be
rubbed with a piece of linen rag dipped in ammonia from gas
tar; the patient should take a little sulphur and molasses, or
some other general aperient, every morning; brushes and
combs should be washed every day, and the ammonia kept
tightly corked.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_99">99</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3749. <em>Another Cure for Ringworms.</em>&mdash;Common sulphur
mixed with butter and pepper till it is a salve: apply twice
a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3750. <em>Invaluable Ointment.</em>&mdash;Obtain a pint of real cream,
let it simmer over the fire, or on the side, till it resembles
butter, and forms a thick oily substance, which maybe used as
ointment for fresh or old wounds, cracked lips or hands.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3751. <em>To avoid catching Cold.</em>&mdash;Accustom yourself to the
use of sponging with cold water every morning on first getting
out of bed. It should be followed with a good deal of rubbing
with a wet towel. It has considerable effect in giving
tone to the skin, and maintaining a proper action in it, and
thus proves a safeguard to the injurious influence of cold and
sudden changes of temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3752. <em>Friction</em> of the body is one of the most gentle and
salutary kinds of exercise, cleaning the skin, dispersing stagnating
humors, promoting perspiration, strengthening the
fibres, and increasing the warmth and energy of the whole
body.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3753. <em>Depilatory.</em>&mdash;Take of sulphate of sodium, or hydro-sulphate
of soda, crystallized, three parts; quick-lime in powder,
ten ditto; starch, ten; mix. This powder, mixed with
a little water, and applied over the skin, acts so rapidly as a
depilatory, that if it be removed in a minute or two after its
application by means of a wooden knife, the surface of the skin
will be entirely deprived of hair.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3754. By this process, the removal of hair becomes so
simple, rapid, and safe in operation, that it will possibly supercede
the use of the razor in many cases; it is only after several
days that the hair begins again to appear.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3755. <em>Brandy and Salt as a Medicine.</em>&mdash;It is useful in the
reduction of inflammation of fractured limbs or bruises, the
alleviation of incurable sores, cure of ringworms, headache,
toothache, inflammation in the eyes, ague, colic, pains in the
side, chilblains, burns and scalds, cancers, sprains, open sores,
asthmas, and complaints of the lungs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3756. Fill a bottle three-quarters full with good brandy,
after which add as much salt as will fill the bottle for corking;
shake it together twenty minutes; let the salt settle to
the bottom, and do not shake it up before using. The clearer
it is used the better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3757. A bottle of this preparation should be constantly
kept ready for use, as its virtues have been fully tested. When
taken inwardly, for asthma, bowel complaints, &amp;c., mix two
spoonfuls with equal quantity of warm water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3758. <em>Cancer.</em>&mdash;Five out of six cases have been cured by
brandy and salt, described above. The pain is very severe,
but temporary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3759. <em>Poison</em>, from vines, may be cured by bathing in whiskey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
and cream, and cooling with rye flour; if obstinate, use a
strong solution of copperas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3760. <em>Simple Remedy for a Pain in the Side.</em>&mdash;At bed-time
take a fresh cabbage-leaf, hold it near the fire till quite
warm, and then apply it to the part affected, binding it tight
with a cloth round the body; let it remain for twelve hours
or more, when it will generally be found to have removed the
pain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3761. If not entirely removed, it will be well to repeat the
application of a fresh leaf, allowing it to remain on the same
time as the first.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3762. <em>Boils.</em>&mdash;See page <a href="#Page_109">109</a>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3763. <em>Carbuncles.</em>&mdash;These should be brought to a head by
warm poultices, by fermentation with hot water, or by stimulating
plasters. When ripe, they should be discharged by a
needle, or the lancet. But this should not be attempted until
they are fully proved.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3764. <em>Constitutional Treatment.</em>&mdash;Stimulating food and
drinks, such as ale, porter, champagne and other wines.
Strong beef tea should be taken freely&mdash;it is very nourishing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3765. <em>Carbuncles reduce the strength greatly.</em>&mdash;To recover
this, Peruvian bark and sea-bathing are recommended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3766. <em>An inflamed bunion</em> should be poulticed, and larger
shoes be worn. Iodine, twelve grains; lard or spermaceti ointment,
half an ounce, makes a capital ointment for bunions. It
should be rubbed on gently twice or thrice a-day.&mdash;See page <a href="#Page_97">97</a>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3767. <em>Frost-Bitten Feet.</em>&mdash;Dissolve half pound alum in one
gallon warm water, and soak fifteen minutes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3768. <em>Valuable Aperient Pills.</em>&mdash;Four drachms Castile
soap, four drachms soccotrine aloes; make into the pills with
a sufficient quantity of syrup. Two or three may be taken
when costive.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3769. <em>Good Eye-Water.</em>&mdash;Ten teaspoonsful of water, one
ditto of brandy, and one ditto of vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3770. <em>Lip Salve.</em>&mdash;Spermaceti ointment, half an ounce; balsam
of Peru, one quarter of a drachm. Mix. It is not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couleur de
rose</i>, but it will <em>cure</em>&mdash;often with but a single application. Apply
a <em>thin</em> coating with the forefinger, just before getting into bed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3771. <em>An Excellent Tooth Powder.</em>&mdash;Cuttle-fish, prepared
chalk, and orris-root, commingled together in equal quantities,
which any one may procure separately from any respectable
chemist, and mix himself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3772. <em>To remove Tartar from the Teeth.</em>&mdash;Strawberries,
ripe, or dried and powdered, are excellent to clean the teeth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3773. <em>To drive away Rats.</em>&mdash;Potash strewn around rat
holes, will drive the vermin away.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3774. <em>To kill Flies.</em>&mdash;Cobalt in powder, moistened with
hot water, and covered with a little sugar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3775. <em>Gum Water.</em>&mdash;It is a fact not generally known that
gum should be dissolved in vinegar instead of water, especially
when it is wanted for immediate use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3776. <em>To remove Water-stains from Black Crape.</em>&mdash;When
a drop of water falls on a black crape vail or collar, it leaves a
conspicuous white mark. To obliterate this, spread the crape
on a table (laying on it a large book or a paper weight to
keep it steady), and place underneath the stain a piece of old
black silk. With a large camel's hair brush dipped in common
ink, go over the stain; and then wipe off the ink with a little
bit of old soft silk. It will dry immediately, and the white
mark will be seen no more.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3777. <em>Copper in liquids</em> maybe detected by spirits of hartshorn,
which turns them blue.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3778. <em>Arsenic</em> may be detected by a solution of blue vitriol
dropped into the suspected liquid, which will turn green, if
arsenic be present.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3779. <em>To remove Ink Stains from Silver.</em>&mdash;The tops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
other portions of silver inkstands frequently become discolored
with ink, which is difficult to remove by ordinary means. It
may, however, be <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'complately'">completely</span> eradicated by making a little
chlorid of lime into a paste with water, and rubbing it upon
the stains.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3780. <em>To remove Ink Stains from Wood, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;As much
oxalic acid as will lay on a sixpence, dissolved in a tablespoonful
of hot water; lay some on the wood, and rub hard with a
cork until the stain disappears; then wash and repolish. The
above will remove the stain, without injury to the color of the
wood, mahogany or any other kind. It also cleans the brass-work.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3781. <em>To Clean Plate.</em>&mdash;Take of cream of tartar, alum, and
common salt, each an ounce, and boil in a gallon of water,
throw the plate in and boil; when taken out and rubbed dry
it will look beautiful. Plate, when laid aside, will generally
tarnish, but if cleaned by this method, at stated periods, it
will always look well.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3782. <em>Washing Paint.</em>&mdash;The best method to wash paint is
to rub some Bath-brick fine, and when you have rubbed some
soap on the flannel, dip it in the brick. This will remove the
grease and dirt speedily, without injury.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3783. <em>Glue Paste.</em>&mdash;Instead of pure water for mixing the
flour, use glue-water, to which add some alum and resin to
keep it from turning. It must be made very thick.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3784. <em>Whenever oil is used</em> for the purpose of artificial
light, it should be kept free from all exposure to atmospheric
air; as it <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'is apt so'">is apt to</span> absorb considerable quantities of oxygen.
If oil is very coarse or tenacious, a very small quantity of oil
of turpentine may be added.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3785. <em>Bugs.</em>&mdash;Spirits of naphtha rubbed with a small
painter's brush into every part of a bedstead is a certain way
of getting rid of bugs.&mdash;(See <a href="#Page_87">p. 87</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3786. <em>Calcareous Deposits in Boilers.</em>&mdash;In a common tea-kettle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
<span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'potatos'">potatoes</span> boiled a few times, will remove the calcareous
deposits, and a few oyster-shells, kept constantly in the kettle,
will prevent future accumulations.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3787. <em>To remove the Stoppers of Glass Bottles.</em>&mdash;Dip a
piece of linen or cloth in hot water, and wrap it tightly round
the neck of the bottle. In a few minutes the stopper will
probably be loosened; if not, repeat the application. I have
never found this method to fail.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3788. <em>How to get a Tight Ring off a Finger.</em>&mdash;Thread a
needle, flat in the eye, with a strong thread, pass the head of
the needle with care under the ring, and pull the thread
through a few inches toward the hand; wrap the long end of
the thread tightly round the finger, regularly all down to the nail,
to reduce its size. Then lay hold of the short end, and unwind
it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3789. The thread repassing against the ring, will gradually
remove it from the finger. This never-failing method will remove
the tightest ring without difficulty, however much swollen
the finger may be.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3790. <em>Cleaning Knives.</em>&mdash;Mutton fat made hot, and put on a
leather or buff-board, with emery-dust&mdash;not powder, as that is
too sharp&mdash;well rubbed in with an old brush, is the best way
of giving a knife as good a polish and edge as any razor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3791. <em>To restore the Color to Mahogany.</em>&mdash;Wash well with
soap and water, and then polish daily with the following oil:
Take half an ounce of alkanet root, cut small, and add to a
pint of linseed oil; when this has stood for a week, add half
an ounce of powdered gum-arabic, and an ounce of shellac
varnish; let them stand in a bottle by the fire for a week, then
strain. Rub well in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3792. <em>Rice Flour Cement.</em>&mdash;An excellent cement may be
made from rice flour, which is at present used for that purpose
in China and Japan. It is only necessary to mix the rice flour
intimately with cold water, and gently simmer it over a fire,
when it readily forms a delicate and durable cement, not only
answering all the purposes of common paste, but admirably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
adapted for joining together paper, cards, &amp;c., in forming the
various beautiful and tasteful ornaments which affords much
employment and amusement to the ladies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3793. When made of the consistence of plaster-clay, models,
busts, bas-relievos, &amp;c. may be formed of it, and the articles,
when dry, are susceptible of high polish, and very durable.&mdash;(See
<a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3794. <em>Oil of Lavender.</em>&mdash;A few drops in a library will
keep the books from moulding. A single drop of the same
will prevent a pint of ink from mouldiness for any length of
time. Paste may be kept from mould entirely by this addition;
and leather is also effectually secured from injury by the
same agency.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3795. <em>Ink.</em>&mdash;To make five gallons of good ink, costing but
twelve-and-a-half cents, take half a pound of extract of logwood,
and dissolve it in five gallons of hot water, and add half
an ounce of bichromate potash. Strain and bottle it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3796. <em>Blue Tracing Ink.</em>&mdash;Indigo tied in a flannel bag,
moistened with water. Put a lump of white sugar into an
egg-cup, and squeeze out the blue on it; the sugar stiffens it,
so as to prevent its running, and the color depends on the
quantity of water used. Use a quill pen.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3797. <em>Marking Linen, preparation.</em>&mdash;The preparation used
for wetting linen, previous to marking it with ink, is a drachm
of salt of tartar in one and a half ounces of water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3798. <em>Economy in Candles.</em>&mdash;If you would burn a candle
all night, unless you use the following precaution, it is ten to
one an ordinary candle will gutter away in an hour or two,
sometimes to the endangering the safety of a house. This
may be avoided by placing as much common salt, finely powdered,
as will reach from the tallow to the bottom of the black
part of the wick of a partly-burnt candle, when, if the same
be lit, it will burn very slowly, yielding sufficient light for a
bed-chamber; the salt will gradually sink as the tallow is consumed,
the melted tallow being drawn through the salt, and
consumed in the wick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3799. <em>Deafness.</em>&mdash;Take three drops of a sheep's gall, warm,
and drop it into the ear on going to bed. The ear must
be thoroughly syringed with warm soap and water in the
morning.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3800. <em>Times of Application.</em>&mdash;The gall must be applied
for three successive nights. It is only efficacious when the
deafness is produced by cold. The most convenient way of
warming the gall is by holding it in a silver spoon over the
flame of a candle.&mdash;(See <a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3801. <em>For Heartburn, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;Orange juice (of one orange),
water and lump sugar to flavor, and in proportion to acidity
of orange, bicarbonate of soda, about half a <span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'teaspooful.'">teaspoonful.</span> Mix
orange juice, water and sugar together in a tumbler, then put
in the soda, stir, and the effervescence ensues.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3802. <em>Remedy for Rheumatism, Lumbago, Sprains, Chilblains,
(before they are broken) Bruises, and Bites of
Insects.</em>&mdash;One raw egg well beaten, half a pint of vinegar, one
ounce of spirits of turpentine, a quarter of an ounce of spirits
of wine, a quarter of an ounce of camphor. These ingredients
to be beaten well together, then put in a bottle and shaken for
ten minutes, after which, to be corked down tightly to exclude
the air. In half an hour it is fit for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3803. <em>How to use it.</em>&mdash;To be well rubbed in, two, three, or
four times a day.&mdash;For rheumatism in the head, to be rubbed
at the back of the neck and behind the ears.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_101">101</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3804. <em>Asthma.</em>&mdash;The following is recommended as a relief.&mdash;Two
ounces of the best honey, and one ounce of castor oil
mixed. A teaspoonful to be taken night and morning.&mdash;(See
page <a href="#Page_103">103</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3805. <em>For Scurf in the Heads of Infants.</em>&mdash;Lard, two
ounces; sulphuric acid, diluted, two drachms; rub them
together, and anoint the head once a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3806. <em>For Moth on the Skin.</em>&mdash;These unpleasant discolorations
may be entirely removed by a wash made of borax and
vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3807. <em>Sunburn.</em>&mdash;A little scraped horseradish mixed in
warm milk and rubbed on the face and hands will whiten the
skin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3808. <em>Cold Cream.</em>&mdash;A piece of sperm candle two inches
long, a small cake of white wax, three table-spoonsful of fresh
sweet oil; just melt it on the fire, stirring it, and take it off
stirring it till it is cold. Before it is quite cold stir in any
perfume you prefer.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_136">136</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3809. <em>A New Method for the Hair.</em>&mdash;Carefully avoid all
lotions and pomades.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3810. Keep the hair and scalp clean by the use of the brush
and comb.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3811. Twice a day, at least, comb it out in such a manner
that the air may pass through it freely; then, with the fingers,
moisten the roots with soft water, at the same time gently
rubbing the scalp.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3812. This will not only fasten and renovate the old hair,
but actually bring out a fine new suit; the length of time for
this purpose varying with the health and constitution of the
patient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3813. Should the hair become too dry, lessen the quantity
of water employed, and use a very little cocoanut or perfumed
castor oil.</p>

<p>This receipt is also invaluable as a remedy for headache or
neuralgia.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3814. <em>Headache&mdash;A Sure Remedy.</em>&mdash;Wet paper, white or
brown, bound tightly on the forehead with a bandage or kerchief,
the part pressing over the forehead to be also made wet
with cold water, though not dripping. This process, if followed
nightly, will entirely prevent headaches, and also keep the forehead
free from wrinkles. Try it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3815. <em>To Promote the Growth of Whiskers, Mustaches,
&amp;c.</em>&mdash;The best method to force the growth of whiskers and
mustaches, is to shave the parts frequently. Use as a stimulant
the ashes of burned tobacco, and bay-water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3816. <em>Cosmetics generally.</em>&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_152">152</a> and on.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3817. <em>The Complexion</em> can only be preserved in freshness,
softness and beauty, by cleanliness, regular exercise, temperance,
a plain diet and pure air, and a cheerful temper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3818. <em>Offensive Breath.</em>&mdash;Use the concentrated solution of
chlorid of soda. From two to five drops of it in a wine-glass
full of pure spring water, taken immediately after the operations
of the morning are completed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3819. In some cases the odor arising from carious teeth is
combined with that of the stomach. If the mouth be well
rinsed with a teaspoonful of the solution of the chlorid in a
tumbler of water, the bad odor of the teeth will be removed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3820. <em>Breath tainted by Onions.</em>&mdash;Leaves of parsley, eaten
with vinegar, will prevent the disagreeable consequences of
eating onions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3821. <em>Toothache.</em>&mdash;Put a small piece of the inside of a nut-gall
into the hollow tooth, and replace by another bit every
half-hour, as long as white matter comes away with the piece
taken out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3822. <em>Black eyes</em> may be cured by a lotion made of equal
parts of gin, vinegar, and cold water mixed. Bathe the eye
for ten or fifteen minutes, and repeat in an hour if the pain
continues.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3823. <em>Bilious Disorders.</em>&mdash;If a person is bilious, it is generally
owing to errors in regimen. Let these be reformed, and
the complaints will cease. But if a person would be always
bilious, let him be often taking calomel, or blue pill, or active
purges. Lee's antibilious, &amp;c., and he will certainly succeed:
the soundest liver will not be proof against such remedies for
bile.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3824. <em>Remedy for Bile.</em>&mdash;The yolks of eggs taken fasting.
If required, beat up the egg with a little sugar and lemon-juice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3825. <em>Household Hints, etc.</em>&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_210">210</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3826. <em>Hard Water.</em>&mdash;When water is hard, and will not
readily unite with soap, it will always be proper to boil it
before use.&mdash;(See pages <a href="#Page_42">42</a>, <a href="#Page_43">43</a>; also "General Washing,"
pages <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, <a href="#Page_47">47</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3827. <em>Materials for Washing.</em>&mdash;The meal of many kinds of
seed may be used for washing, as well as various kinds of
bran. That of almonds, which, on account of its oil, is remarkably
soft, is employed at present for washing the hands,
by those who are desirous of having a white delicate skin.
Cloth, the colors of which easily fade, and which will neither
endure soap nor hard rubbing, may be washed extremely well
with bran. Our fullers, therefore, and stocking-manufacturers,
use oats, barley, and bran meal, especially when they wish the
cloth to be slowly milled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3828. <em>To Wash White Lace.</em>&mdash;Cover a glass bottle with
calico or linen, and then tack the lace or collar smoothly upon
it, rub it with soap, and cover it with calico. Boil it for
twenty minutes in soft water; let all dry together, and the
lace will be found to be ready for use.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3829. A long piece of lace must be wound round and round
the bottle, the edge of each round a little above the last, and
a few stitches to keep it firm at the beginning and end will be
found sufficient, but a collar will require more tacking to keep
it in its place.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_53">53</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3830. <em>Bleaching Liquid.</em>&mdash;Take one pound of chlorid of
lime, empty it into a stone jar, and pour on it one gallon of
water; stir it well with a stick for fifteen minutes; then let it
settle, and pour off the clear liquor into clean bottles, and
cork them up. A tumblerful of this preparation, added to a
tubful of water, in which the clothes are rinsed, will add very
much to their whiteness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3831. <em>Washing Windows.</em>&mdash;The nicest article for washing
windows is deer skin, as no particles come off to adhere to the
glass and make it look as if washed with feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3832. Wash-leather and a bowl of suds are all that are
necessary. Wipe the glass first with the wet cloth or leather,
and after it has become dry, with the clean cloth; and it will
look clear, and far more so than if rinsed in a dozen pails of
water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3833. <em>Cleaning Kid Gloves.</em>&mdash;Lay the gloves flat on a towel,
and wash them with a piece of clean flannel and the best
<em>yellow</em> soap, being careful to squeeze the flannel as dry as it is
possible to use it. When the dirt is removed, with another
piece of flannel wash them lightly with plain milk.&mdash;(See
page <a href="#Page_53">53</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3834. <em>Stains</em> may be removed from the hands by washing
them in a small quantity of oil of vitriol and cold water without
soap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3835. <em>Cleaning Velvets.</em>&mdash;A very simple method of cleaning
velvets is to procure a small square of pipe-clay (such as the
soldiers use to clean their uniforms with) and scrape a little
off upon the velvet; then take a brush, made of the same
material as the carpet-whisk, and lightly brush it off. This
raises the pile, and restores the bloom.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3836. <em>Silk articles</em> should not be kept folded in white
papers, as the chlorid of lime used in bleaching the paper
will impair the color of the silk.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3837. <em>Papier-Mache</em> articles should be washed with a
sponge and cold water without soap, dredged with flour while
damp, and polished with a flannel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3838. <em>Worsted and Lambs'-Wool Stockings</em> should never
be mended with worsted or lambs'-wool, because the latter
being new it shrinks more than the stockings, and draws them
up till the toes become short and narrow, and the heels have
no shape left.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3839. <em>In choosing Paper for a room</em>, avoid that which
has a variety of colors, or a large, showy figure, as no furniture
can appear to advantage with such. Large figured
papering makes a small room look smaller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3840. <em>Bright green colors</em> are dangerous when first put on,
because poisons are used in the coloring matter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3841. <em>Gilt frames</em> may be protected from flies and dust by
oiled tarlatan pinned over them. Tarlatan already prepared,
may be purchased at the upholsterers'. If it cannot be procured,
it is easily made by brushing boiled oil over cheap
tarlatan. It is an excellent material for keeping dust from
books, vases, woodwork, and every description of household
ornament.&mdash;(See page <a href="#Page_18">18</a>.)</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3842. <em>To Pack Glass or China.</em>&mdash;Procure some soft straw
or hay to pack them in, and if they are to be sent a long way,
and are heavy, the hay or straw should be a little damp, which
will prevent them slipping about. Let the largest and heaviest
things be always put undermost, in the box or hamper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3843. Let there be plenty of straw, and pack the articles
tight; but never attempt to pack up glass or china which is
of much consequence, till it has been seen done by some one
used to the job. The expense will be but trifling to have a
person to do it who understands it, and the loss may be great
if articles of such value are packed up in an improper manner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3844. <em>To Polish Enameled Leather.</em>&mdash;Two pints of the
best cream, one pint of linseed oil; make them each lukewarm,
and then mix them well together.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>DIETETIC MAXIMS.</h4>

<p>3845. A healthy appetite is to be acquired by early rising,
regular exercise in the open air, a cheerful mind, and abstinence
from intoxicating liquors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3846. The food should be eaten slowly, so that it be well
masticated and mixed with the saliva.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3847. Animal food is sooner digested in the stomach than
vegetable; but it is more stimulating or heating to the system.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
Flesh that has been long salted, dried hams, beef, &amp;c., are less
easily digested and less nutritive than fresh meat.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3848. Farinaceous and vegetable food, generally, is slower
of digestion than animal, but it is less heating; many kinds
of vegetable food are very nutritive.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3849. Solid food, or food of a certain fibrous or pulpy consistence,
is more fitted for digestion in the stomach than rich
soups, jellies, and all highly concentrated sauces. The latter
are rendered more digestible by the addition of bread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3850. Fish are not so nourishing as the flesh of land animals,
and with many stomachs entirely disagree. The white
fish, when in season, are generally lighter, and less apt to
disagree with the stomach than the red.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3851. In summer the food should consist principally of
vegetables; in winter, a larger amount of animal matter may
be taken, especially by the laborer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3852. Boiling renders food more tender and digestible, but
it deprives it of a considerable portion of its nutritive principle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3853. Animal food should not be over boiled; vegetables
should be boiled until perfectly tender.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3854. Roasting dissipates less of the nutritive parts of the
meat. Roasted meat is, therefore, more nourishing than
boiled, but much more stimulating.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3855. Bread constitutes a wholesome addition to all our
meals. It should be perfectly raised, fully baked, and one
day old.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3856. All excess in eating should be avoided, but the quantity
of food proper to be taken at one time depends entirely
on the constitution, age, habits, degree of health, season of the
year, climate, &amp;c. The best guide is to be found in the calls
of a healthy appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3857. Health, and strength of body, depend upon the health
of the stomach, and consequent perfection of the digestive
powers, much more than upon the quantity or even quality of
the food taken.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3858. Water is the most wholesome drink. Toast and
water, sweetened water, or water with a slight addition of a
vegetable acid, are useful diluents during the summer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3859. Distilled and fermented liquors impede digestion;
and, when drank to any great extent, invariably destroy the
tone of the stomach, and of the system generally.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3860. The stomach ought not to be over distended with
fluids during, immediately preceding, nor after a meal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3861. When the stomach is very weak, very little fluid
should be taken during or after eating. Dry solid food
requires more dilution than that which is juicy or fluid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3862. Exercise should be used in the intervals between
meals, but not immediately before or after them.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HINTS TO MECHANICS AND WORKMEN.</h4>

<p>3863. If you would avoid the diseases which your particular
trades and work are liable to produce, attend to the following
hints:</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3864. Keep, if possible, regular hours. Never suppose that
you have done extra work, when you sit up till midnight, and
do not rise till eight or nine in the morning.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3865. Abstain from ardent spirits, cordials, and malt
liquors. Let your drink be, like that of Franklin, when he
was a printer&mdash;pure water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3866. Never use tobacco in any form. By chewing, smoking,
or snuffing, you spend money which would help to clothe
you, or would enable you, if single, to make a useful present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
to an aged mother or dependent sister; or, if married, to buy
your wife a frock, or get books for your children. You also,
by any of these filthy practices, injure your health&mdash;bringing
on headache, gnawing at the stomach, low spirits, trembling
of the limbs, and, at times, sleeplessness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3867. Be particular in preserving your skin clean, by regular
washing of your hands, and face, and mouth, before each
meal, and of your whole body at least once a week, and by
combing and brushing the hair daily.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3868. Always have fresh air in the room in which you work,
but so that you shall not be in a draft.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3869. Take a short time in the morning, if possible, and
always in the evening, or toward sundown, for placing your
body in a natural posture, by standing erect, and exercising
your chest and limbs by a walk where the air is the purest.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3870. <em>The Fireside.</em>&mdash;Admit no rival here. Let your chief
joys be shared by her who has forsaken all other hearts and
hopes for you; by those who must inherit honor or disgrace
from your course of life. Shun the bar-room and the purlieus
of intoxication. They are, to thousands, the avenues to
infamy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3871. <em>The rivals</em> of our Home are many and fearful.
Among the direst is the drinking-place, whether known as
porter-house, grog-shop, or tavern. The man who spends his
evenings in these Stygian fumes, soon grovels and wallows
away half his civilization.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3872. <em>The tavern-haunter</em> drinks till he feels himself half-ruined;
he is wretched; he drinks to drown his wretchedness;
he does drown it, and his soul along with it!</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3873. <em>Home!</em>&mdash;It marks the sacred spot to which the cares
and tumult of the world do not reach; and where, except in
cases of extreme depravity, its vices do not intrude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>MAXIMS AND MORALS FOR ALL MEN.</h4>

<p>3874. The world estimates men by their success in life; and,
by general consent, success is evidence of superiority.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3875. Never, under any circumstances, assume a responsibility
you can avoid consistently with your duty to yourselves
and others.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3876. Base all your actions upon a principle of right; preserve
your integrity of character in doing this; never reckon
the cost.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3877. Remember that self-interest is more likely to warp
your judgment than all other circumstances combined; therefore
look well to your duty when your duty is concerned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3878. Never make money at the expense of your reputation.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3879. Be neither lavish nor niggardly; of the two avoid the
latter. A mean man is universally despised; but public
favor is a stepping-stone to preferment&mdash;therefore generous
feelings should be cultivated.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3880. Let your expenses be such as to leave a balance in
your pocket. Ready money is a friend in need.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3881. Keep clear of the law; for when you gain your case,
you are generally a loser of money.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3882. Never relate your misfortunes, and never grieve over
what you cannot prevent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3883. No man who owes as much as he can pay, has any
moral right to endorse for another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3884. No moneyed man has the moral right to enter on engagements
or speculations, hazarding his estate, without the
consent of his wife.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3885. Knowing that the end of life is death, every right-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
man ought to pursue that which is connected with
happiness and ultimate bliss.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3886. <em>Family Tool Chests, Papers, etc.</em>&mdash;Much inconvenience
and considerable expense might be saved, if it was the
general custom to keep in every house certain tools for the
purpose of performing at home what are called small jobs, instead
of being always obliged to send for a mechanic, and pay
him for executing little things that, in most cases, could be
sufficiently well done by a man or boy belonging to the family,
provided that the proper instruments were at hand.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3887. The cost of these articles is very trifling, and the
advantages of having them always in the house are far beyond
the expense.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3888. For instance there should be an axe, a hatchet, a
saw (a large wood saw, also, with a buck or stand, if wood is
burned), a claw-hammer, a mallet, two gimlets of different
sizes, two screw-drivers, a chisel, a small plane, one or two
jack-knives, a pair of large scissors or shears, and a carpet-fork
or stretcher.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3389. Also an assortment of nails of various sizes from
large spikes down to small tacks, not forgetting brass-headed
nails, some larger and some smaller.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3890. Screws and likewise, will be found to be very convenient,
and hooks on which to hang things.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3891. The nails and screws should be kept in a wooden box,
made with division to separate the various sorts, for it is very
troublesome to have them mixed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3892. And let care be taken to keep up the supply, lest it
should ran out unexpectedly, and the deficiency cause delay
and inconvenience at a time when their use is wanted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3893. It is well to have somewhere, in the lower part of the
house, a deep, light closet, appropriated entirely to tools and
things of equal utility, for executing promptly such little repairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
as convenience may require, without the delay or expense
of procuring an artisan. This closet should have at least one
large shelf, and that about three feet from the floor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3894. Beneath this shelf may be a deep drawer, divided into
two compartments. This drawer may contain cakes of glue,
pieces of chalk, and balls of twine of different size and quality.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3895. There may be shelves at the sides of the closet for
glue-pots, paste-pots, and brushes, pots for black, white, green,
and red paints, cans of painting oil, paint-brushes, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3896. Against the wall, above the large shelf, let the tools
be suspended, or laid across nails or hooks of proper size to
support them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3897. This is much better than keeping them in a box,
where they may be injured by rubbing against each other, and
the hand may be hurt in feeling among them to find the thing
that is wanted.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3898. But when hung up against the back wall of the closet,
of course each tool can be seen at a glance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3899. Wrapping paper may be piled on the floor under the
large shelf. It can be bought very low by the ream, at the
large paper warehouses; and every house should keep a supply
of it in several varieties.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3900. For instance, coarse brown paper for common purposes,
that denominated ironmonger's paper, which is strong,
thick, and in large sheets, is useful for packing heavy articles;
and equally so for keeping silks, ribbons, blondes, &amp;c., as it
preserves their colors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3901. Printed papers are unfit for wrapping any thing, as
the printing ink rubs off on the articles enclosed in them and
also soils the gloves of the person who carries the parcel.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3902. When shopping, if the person at the counter proceeds
to wrap up your purchase in a newspaper (a thing rarely
attempted in a genteel shop), refuse to take it in such a cover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3903. It is the business of every respectable shopkeeper to
provide proper paper for this purpose; and printed paper is
not proper.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3904. Waste newspapers had best be used for lighting fires
and singing poultry.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3905. Waste paper that has been written on, cut into slips,
and creased and folded, makes very good alumettes or lamp-lighters.
These matters may appear of trifling importance,
but order and regularity are necessary to happiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3906. <em>A Miniature Tool Box</em> for little boys is one of the
best playthings which can be given them. These can be
found at the toy-shops.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HOME INDUSTRY FOR YOUNG LADIES.</h4>

<p>3907. <em>Dress-making.</em>&mdash;When you are about to commence a
dress, have the following things in a basket or box at your
hand, viz: sewing silk the color of the dress, one or two reels
of cotton, fine and coarse, a pair of scissors, not small, a penny
inch measure&mdash;you can procure one at a trimming shop.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3908. Do not cut without a measure, and always measure
all that you have bought or have given you for a dress, before
you begin to cut.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3909. The number of yards required depend on the width
of the material. Ten yards of any material, eighteen inches
wide, will make a dress for a moderate-sized person, with full
body, but no trimming on the skirt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3910. Cut your plain skirt off the piece first, body and
sleeves after; leave your trimmings to the last; large turnings
are bad and waste the stuff; measure carefully and cut exact.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3911. Six yards of French merino, or any other material
of that width, will be found sufficient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3912. In cutting off the skirt, if the length, we will suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
should be forty-two or forty-six inches long, leave four inches
more for the hem and turnings at the top.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3913. Cut the lining for the skirt exact to the material, and
mind it fits when finished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3914. Supposing you to have run the seams of the skirt and
the seams of your lining, lay the lining on the table, placing
the skirt on top, and then tack the seams of your skirt to the
lining.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3915. Begin at the first seam, and gradually go on to the
last seam; stitch up three pieces together, and fell over the
fourth; having done this, hem the bottom. Unless your hem
is tacked or pinned, it will be sure to be on the twist and set
badly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3916. Having done this, run on your braid, which must be
put on easy or rather full. Attend to this, or you will spoil
the set of the skirt. If the skirt is to have flounces, they must
be put on before you gauge the top; and while the skirt is on
the table, put a white tacking thread round the skirt where
each flounce is to be fixed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3917. <em>Waist or Body.</em>&mdash;All thin figures ought to wear full
bodies; with stout persons it is a matter of taste. Plain
bodies require more care in making than full ones. Every
small imperfection is seen in plain bodies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3918. Care and judgment are necessary in fitting the back
of the dress over the shoulders; or you will look round-shouldered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3919. The fault is, usually, in cutting the back of the dress
too long; in fitting, pull the fore-body over the shoulder, and
shorten the back at the top, till it fits neatly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3920. If you have no paper pattern that fits, unpick half an
old body that suits you; lay your new lining on your cutting
board (the top of a candle-box, or any smooth board
of sufficient width, will answer to hold in your lap, and is more
convenient than standing over a bed or table), put the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
body on top of it, and, with the sharp point of a pair of scissors,
prick through both, in the old seams of the pattern.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3921. Prick them <em>well</em>, as the marks are apt to rub out.
Tack all the body well in the holes round it, before you
begin, and be very careful to stitch your body to the tacking
thread.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3922. Plain bodies require more care in making than full
ones; any small imperfection is seen in plain bodies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3923. Five out of six persons have their dresses made too
tight across the chest; it is a sad fault. Any lady once wearing
an easy dress, would never go back to a tight one; to say
nothing of its being healthy and beautiful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3924. Do not select a very stout body lining; it is a common
mistake. A stout lining prevents the dress giving or
setting to the figure, and is no stronger than one of moderate
quality. French dressmakers exclaim at the bad shapes so
commonly seen in this country, and charge them to this cause
in a great measure. For a white dress, lawn, cambric, chintz,
or silk&mdash;bleached muslin, at twelve and a half cents a yard, is
good enough. For dark merinos, or cashmeres, some prefer
dark twilled stuffs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3925. A yard of lining is the proper quantity for a close
dress, a yard and a half for a basque or jacket. Sleeve linings
should always be of a thin material.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3926. Great care must be taken with the armholes; do not
make them too large or too small; thirteen inches is a nice
size for a person not more than twenty-four inches in the
waist; fourteen inches is a large size, only required for stout
persons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3927. If you have to alter the armhole, never do it under
the arm; in nine cases out of ten it will spoil the dress, and
it takes away the free use of the arm; a very small piece cut
off round the armhole, excepting underneath, will be all that
is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3928. Do not forget your sleeves must be larger than the
armhole an inch and a half; when put in, it never looks the
least full, and sets better. The seam of your sleeve must not
be even with the seam of your body, but half an inch in front
of it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3929. In cording the neck, do not stretch it; hold the cord
tight. The waist must, on the contrary, be pulled well when
the cord is put on, or it will never fit; it requires much stretching.
The fit of the body often depends on the finishing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3930. All full bodies are made with quite a straight piece
of material, twenty inches long, and eighteen wide; this is
half the front; gather it straight at the bottom, and then place
it on your tight lining; fix it firmly, and then gather it at the
shoulder; but mind and do the bottom gauging first.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3931. To make a body with folds, still have your material
twenty inches long, and nineteen wide; the selvage must
reach from waist to shoulder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3932. In putting folds on a body, let it be on the straight,
or a good cross; don't let it be neither one nor the other,
which is too frequently the case, and always will, as a matter
of course, set badly. It makes the folds set better to cover
over half the body lining with a plain piece of the dress, as
you would wear a stomacher, and then place your folds to
meet it, so that a folded body will be in two pieces, the plain
part put on first, and the folds after.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3933. A French dressmaker uses <em>little or no bone</em>&mdash;that is,
the splints are so thin as to bend and give to the outline, and
to every motion of the figure. The fit should not be made to
depend on a stiff fencing of whalebone, the thickness of an old-fashioned
busk. If it does not fit nicely without any bone, it
never will fit with. This is true of low-bodied evening dresses
in particular, the only dresses which at present have long
points to the bodice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3934. The <em>basque</em>, properly speaking, is the short skirt or
flap, of the body. They require a paper pattern, which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
be furnished to any distance by those establishments who
make patterns a business. There are several such in New York
and Philadelphia.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3935. It is a good plan to fit the jacket lining to the figure
first, before you cut into the material. They should always
be left loose to the figure; the whole effect being destroyed
if any seams are drawn tight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3936. <em>Flounces.</em>&mdash;It will take the same quantity of material
if cut either on the straight or the cross. It is a common
error to suppose they take more on the cross.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3937. For the fullness of a flounce allow one width on the
cross to one width on the straight of your skirt; so that if you
have six widths in your skirts, you will have six widths in
your flounces on the cross.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3938. If there are three flounces of different widths, let the
bottom and widest one have the most fullness; three inches
more fullness will be sufficient. If the flounces are on the
straight, allow eight widths in the flounce to six widths in the
skirt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3939. A small cord run in at the top of the flounce makes
it look neat. Before running the cord in your flounce, join it
round the exact size of the skirt; join round likewise your
flounces, and full them on the cord as you go on.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3940. Halve and quarter your flounces and also the skirt,
and you will find them no trouble to put on.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3941. <em>Sleeves.</em>&mdash;In making sleeves, with one good pattern,
strange as it may seem, you can very easily make six different
fashions by cutting your sleeve a little longer or a little
shorter, and putting on different trimmings, by making some
in a band at the wrist, or leaving them loose, by trimming the
loose sleeves on the back or fore part of the arm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3942. The same shape is, by a dressmaker, altered in the
manner I describe, and with a little observation, I think, can
be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3943. Try and procure a good pattern at first. With taste,
one pattern can be made to look like six.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3944. A trimming on the top of the sleeve is a great improvement
to thin persons. It should match the bottom part
of the sleeve and body-trimming.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3945. Two out of every three American women have one
shoulder larger than the other, from stooping in the school-room,
or the early care of children.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3946. A light layer of cotton on the lining of the opposite
shoulder, and covered with the same material, will often conceal,
or at least soften this unpleasant defect.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3947. Trimmings down the front of a dress when on the
cross, should be cut the same as flounces. In trimming the
front of a skirt, it is a good plan to cut a paper the length of
the skirt, and pin it on the way you intend to trim, and then
tack a tacking thread by it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3948. Put tackings wherever you mean to trim, before you
begin trimming, and lay your skirt on a table to do it; put
on all trimmings with a light hand; do not sew them as you
would a shirt, it gives them a puckered look. Now mind, a
good cross; no attempts at making pieces do, unless they are
good corner pieces, that will join well; <em>you are more sure
of making a trimming well if cut all from one piece</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3949. Before cutting a skirt off that you wish to put tucks
in, have a piece of lining or calico at hand, pin the tucks in it
as you wish to put them in your skirt.</p>

<p>As a general rule, a tucked skirt takes more than a flounced
one, and makes less show for the quantity of material used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>PETS.</h4>
<p><em>Canaries</em>, (see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>) <em>and other Birds</em>.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>3950. <em>Canaries</em> become delicate and feeble from improper
treatment. Their docility, beautiful plumage, and sweetness
of notes render them general favorites. When young, feed on
a paste made by bruising rape-seed, blowing the chaff away,
mixed with pieces of bread powdered. Give a teaspoonful
with a little hard egg and a few drops of water, when turning
sour, mix fresh. Add, as they grow older, scalded rape-seed
without bruising, chopped almond and chickweed, in hot weather,
twice a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3951. If sick, give milk of hemp-seed, made by bruising
clean seed and straining it through linen into water, taking
the water-glass away from the sick. As they advance in age,
give rape and canary, and occasionally bruised hemp-seed,
taking the soft food away by degrees. Cuttle-fish bone is preferable
to loaf-sugar. Cakes, apples, berries, bread soaked,
the water squeezed out and milk added, are good, and cabbage
occasionally, when in season, is excellent.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3952. <em>Perches</em> should be round and strong without crevices
or shoulders for insects to breed or harbor, and every corner
of the cage should be brushed out and kept thoroughly clean.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3953. <em>The claws</em> are sometimes so long as to occasion accidents
by catching in the wires; in which case trim them.</p>

<p><em>Mortar</em> placed in the cage facilitates the production of eggs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3954. <em>Teach</em> singing by separating the bird from the others,
so that he may hear no singing, cover his cage for a few days
with a thin cloth, then play your flageolet or bird organ several
times each day, without harshness. At the end of fifteen
days, change the thin cloth for a thick green or red serge, and
keep covered till perfect in the air you wish to teach. Feed
once a day and night. It is better to teach one good tune well
than several imperfectly. The bird will copy all imperfections.
<em>Bad</em> or dull singers are improved by hearing the more spirited
and perfect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3955. <em>Surfeit</em> indicated by swelling of lower part of body,
and occasioned by too much chickweed, salad, or soft food.
Put alum in the water for three or four days, or put a rusty
nail in the water, or common salt. Put the bird, if bad, in
lukewarm milk a few minutes, then wash with water, wipe and
dry gently.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3956. <em>Sick birds</em> may have boiled bread and milk with canary
seed boiled in it; lettuce seed; and when moulting, or
renewing its feathers, indicated by drooping, putting its head
under its wing, dropping small feathers, give nourishing food,
as hemp-seed, sponge, biscuit, &amp;c., keep warm and quiet, and
keep much in the sun. A cold air or draft is injurious. Put
in the water a little refined liquorice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3957. <em>American Yellow Bird.</em>&mdash;Beautiful plumage and fine
song. They are hardy, and the cage should be often hung out.
Give plenty of water, gravel, rich oily seeds, with occasional
sunflower and lettuce seeds; leaves of beet, salad, apples, and
other fruits.</p>

<p><em>Gold Finch.</em>&mdash;Treat similar to American yellow bird.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3958. <em>Bullfinches.</em>&mdash;Old birds should be fed with German
Paste, No. 2, and occasionally rape-seed. The Germans occasionally
give them a little poppy-seed, and a grain or two of
rice, steeped in canary wine, when teaching them to pipe, as a
reward for the progress they make. Bird organs or flageolets,
are used to teach them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3959. <em>Cardinal Grosbeak.</em>&mdash;Of splendid plumage and exquisite
song. They are hardy and may be kept without fire in
a room most of the winter, except in the northern States.
Allow frequent air and sun. Feed on rough unhulled rice and
hemp, wheat, brown gravel, cracked corn, and millet occasionally,
with plenty of water for bathing. These birds are long
lived; the Philadelphia Museum having one which died when
twenty-one years old.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3960. <em>Java Sparrow.</em>&mdash;Very delicate, with pretty plumage,
but little music. Feed on unhulled rice and canary seed, with
plenty of brown gravel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3961. <em>Purple Finch or Linnet.</em>&mdash;A delightful songster.
Give canary, hemp, millet, and sunflower seeds, with juniper
and cedar-berries through the winter, salad and beet-tops in
summer. Any other of the Finch tribe may be fed on seeds generally,
as the preceding. Perfect cleanliness of the cage, and
a constant supply of fresh water and gravel are essential.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3962. <em>Baltimore Oriole.</em>&mdash;A bird of delightful plumage,
and rich brilliant music, well repaying the utmost care. They
eat fruit of all kinds, seeds, insects, &amp;c. Give them a large
cage, protection from frost, and an abundance of insects.
Rear same as mocking bird.</p>

<p><em>East India Oriole.</em>&mdash;Possesses greater musical powers, and
is to be treated same as the Baltimore.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3963. <em>American Mocking Bird.</em>&mdash;The sweet "bird of many
voices," imitating almost every variety of notes and sounds
imaginable. Feed regularly every morning with Indian meal
mixed with milk, not very stiff. Give wild cherries, cedar,
elder, poke, and whortleberries. An occasional egg, boiled
hard and grated; a little raw minced beef; water for washing
as well as drink, with plenty of insects, grasshoppers, spiders,
particularly during moulting, when they should be kept quiet
and away from cold drafts of air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3964. <em>Regular feeding</em> is important. Adopt a regular hour,
say eight o'clock in the morning for feeding and watering, and
strictly adhere to it.</p>

<p><em>If sickly</em>, treat kindly, give spiders daily, and meal-worms;
gravel the bottom of the cage and keep very quiet.</p>

<p><em>The male</em> has a regular line of white feathers in the wing,
forming almost a regular curve from tip to shoulder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3965. <em>American Robin.</em>&mdash;Sprightly, beautiful, and musical.
Treat similar to mocking bird.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3966. <em>Reed Bird or Bob-o-link.</em>&mdash;Is apt to die in November,
if too well fed. Give oats, buckwheat, and canary seed, and
abundant water for bathing. At other seasons feed same indiscriminately,
as the Finch tribe.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3967. <em>Chickweed</em> or salad, which in proper season is excellent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
are absolutely poison if given too early, before the
bitterness is off, and the cold acrid juices are dissipated by the
sun.</p>

<p><em>Insects from Bird-cages, Drawers, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;To keep away
insects from birds' eyes, suspend a little bag of sulphur in
the cage. This is said to be healthful for birds generally,
as well as serving to keep away insects by which they become
infested.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3968. <em>Aviaries.</em>&mdash;The aviary must face the south or west;
the ground within may be covered with fine turf, and divided
by gravel walks. The evergreens planted inside are, phyllerca,
holly, laurel, Portugal laurel, lauristinus, yew, box, and
furze. The building should be principally wire, and open to
the air, but there should be wings on either side, protected by
a roof of wood or glass. In putting goldfinches, linnets, and
canaries in an aviary for the purpose of breeding, the males
of the two former should be put in with hen canaries as the
male birds of the wild species will mate only with canaries.
Two or three male canaries may be put amongst them, as the
young male birds will learn some of the canaries' notes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3969. <em>Gold-fish.</em>&mdash;Great care must be taken of gold-fish, as
they are very susceptible; and hence a loud noise, strong
smell, violent or even slight shaking of the vessel, will ofttimes
destroy them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3970. <em>Food for Gold-fish.</em>&mdash;Foreign vermicelli, in minute
portions, given at intervals of two or three days, is the very
best aliment for gold-fish. A frequent cause of their death is
injudicious food, and too much of it; bread kills them, and
biscuit is scarcely to be trusted, because the materials of which
it is composed are not always pure. Water contains so much
nourishment, that if it be changed every day, little food need
be given in addition. The most proper situation for a globe
of fish is near a window, but not in the direct rays of the sun.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3971. <em>Squirrels.</em>&mdash;In a domestic state these little animals
are fed with hazel nuts, or indeed any kind of nuts; and occasionally
bread and milk. They should be kept very clean.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3972. <em>Birdlime.</em>&mdash;Take any quantity of linseed oil, say half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
a pint; put it into an old pot, or any vessel that will stand
the fire without breaking; the vessel must not be more than
one-third full, put it on a slow fire, stir it occasionally until it
thickens as much as required; this will be known by cooling
the stick in water, and trying it with the fingers. It is best
to make it rather harder than for use. Then pour it into cold
water. It can be brought back to the consistency required
with a little Archangel tar.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3973. <em>Pet Dogs</em> should never be washed with soap. They
should be washed with beaten eggs, and afterward washed
with warm water. The best way to keep a dog healthy is to let
him have plenty of exercise, and not to over-feed him.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3974. <em>Drink.</em>&mdash;Let them at all times have a plentiful supply
of clean water, and encourage them to take to swimming,
as it assists their cleanliness.</p>

<p><em>Washing.</em>&mdash;When you wash them do not use a particle
of soap, or you will prevent their licking themselves, and they
may become habitually dirty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3975. <em>Feeding.</em>&mdash;Properly-treated dogs, should be fed only
once a day. Meat boiled for dogs and the liquor in which it
is boiled, thickened with barley-meal, or oatmeal, forms capital
food.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3976. <em>Sickness.</em>&mdash;The distemper is liable to attack dogs from
four months to four years old. It prevails most in spring and
autumn. The disease is known by dulness of the eye, husky
cough, shivering, loss of appetite and spirits, and fits. When
fits occur, the dog will most likely die, unless a veterinary surgeon
is called in.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3977. <em>Remedies.</em>&mdash;During the distemper, dogs should be allowed
to run on the grass; their diet should be spare; and a little
sulphur be placed in their water. Chemists who dispense cattle
medicines can generally advise with sufficient safety upon the
diseases of dogs, and it is best for unskillful persons to abstain
from physicking them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3978. <em>Hydrophobia.</em>&mdash;Hydrophobia is the most dreadful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
all diseases. The first symptoms are attended by thirst, fever,
and languor. The dog starts convulsively in his sleep, and
when awake, though restless, is languid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3979. <em>Treatment.</em>&mdash;When a dog is suspected, he should be
firmly chained in a place where neither children nor dogs nor
cats can get near him. Any one going to attend him should
wear thick leather gloves, and proceed with great caution.
When a dog snaps savagely at an imaginary object, it is almost
a certain indication of madness; and when it exhibits a terror
of fluids, it is confirmed hydrophobia.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3980. <em>Music.</em>&mdash;Some dogs exhibit a great dislike of musical
sounds, and when this is the case they are too frequently
made sport of. But it is dangerous sport, as dogs have sometimes
been driven mad by it. In many diseases dogs will be
benefitted by warm baths.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3981. <em>Mange.</em>&mdash;The mange is a contagious disease, which
is difficult to get rid of when once contracted. The best way
is to apply to a veterinary chemist for an ointment, and to
keep applying it for some time after the disease has disappeared,
or it will break out again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3982. <em>Cats.</em>&mdash;It is generally supposed that cats are more
attached to places than to individuals, but this is an error.
They obstinately cling to certain places, because it is there they
expect to see the persons to whom they are attached. A cat
will return to an empty house, and remain in it many weeks.
But, when at last she finds that the family does not return, she
strays away, and if she chances then to find the family, she will
abide with them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3983. <em>Rules, &amp;c.</em>&mdash;The same rules of feeding which apply
to dogs apply also to cats. They should not be over-fed, nor
too frequently. Cats are liable to the same diseases as dogs;
though they do not become ill so frequently. A little brimstone
in their milk occasionally, is a good preventive. The veterinary
chemist will also prescribe for the serious diseases of
cats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>SWIMMING.</h4>

<p>3984. The art of swimming is, in fact, very easy, and those
persons who take the few brief hints we are about to offer, will
soon find themselves rewarded by complete success.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3985. The first consideration is not to attempt to learn to
swim too soon. That is, you must not expect to succeed in
your efforts to swim until you have become accustomed to the
water, and have overcome your repugnance to the coldness
and novelty of bathing. Every attempt will fail until you
have acquired a certain confidence in the water, and then the
difficulty will soon vanish.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3986. <em>Dr. Franklin's Advice to Swimmers.</em>&mdash;"The only
obstacle to improvement in this necessary and life-preserving
art, is fear; and it is only by overcoming this timidity that
you can expect to become a master of the following acquirements."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3987. It is very common for novices in the art of swimming
to make use of corks or bladders to assist in keeping the body
above water; some have utterly condemned the use of them;
however, they may be of service for supporting the body, while
one is learning what is called the stroke, or that manner of
drawing in and striking out the hands and feet, that is necessary
to produce progressive motion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3988. The practice I mean is this: choosing a place where
the water deepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is up to
your breast; then turn round your face to the shore, and throw
an egg into the water between you and the shore; it will sink
to the bottom, and be easily seen there if the water is clean.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3989. It must lie in the water so deep that you cannot
reach to take it up but by diving for it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3990. To encourage yourself, in order to do this, reflect that
your progress will be from deep to shallow water, and that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
any time you may, by bringing your legs under you, and standing
on the bottom, raise your head far above the water; then,
plunge under with your eyes open, which must be kept open
before going under, as you cannot open the eyelids for the
weight of water above you; throwing yourself toward the egg,
and endeavoring, by the action of your hands and feet against
the water, to get forward till within reach of it. In this
attempt you will find that the water buoys you up against
your inclination; that it is not so easy to sink as you imagine;
and that you cannot, but by active force get down to the egg.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3991. Thus you feel the power of water to support you,
and learn to confide in that power while your endeavors to
overcome it and reach the egg, teach you the manner of acting
on the water with your feet and hands, which action is
afterward used in swimming to support your head higher above
the water, or to go forward through it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3992. The exercise of swimming is one of the most healthy
and agreeable in the world.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3993. Let every boy and girl, if possible, be taught this
healthful and life-preserving art.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3994. <em>Life-Belts.</em>&mdash;An excellent and cheap life-belt, for
persons proceeding to sea, bathing in dangerous places, or
learning to swim, may be thus made:&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3995. Take a yard and three-quarters of strong jean,
double and divide it into nine compartments. Let there be a
space of two inches after each third compartment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3996. Fill the compartments with very fine cuttings of cork,
which may be made by cutting up old corks, or (still better)
purchased at the cork-cutters.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3997. Work eyelet-holes at the bottom of each compartment
to let the water drain out.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3998. Attach a neck-band and waist strings of stout boot-web,
and sew them on strongly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>3999. <em>Another.</em>&mdash;Cut open an old boa, or victorine, and
line it with fine cork-cuttings instead of wool.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4000. For ladies going to sea these are excellent, as they
may be worn in stormy weather, without giving appearance
of alarm in danger. They may be fastened to the body by
ribands or tapes, of the color of the fur. Gentlemen's waistcoats
may be lined the same way.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4001. <em>Rules to Govern Persons who have Fallen into Deep
Water.</em>&mdash;1. As soon as you find yourself at the surface, whither
you are raised by your buoyancy, let your body quickly take
its level, when the water will reach a little above your chin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4002. 2. Place one leg a little forward, the other a little
backward, and stretch out your arms on either side under the
water. By a slight paddling motion you may regulate the
position of your head, and keep the mouth and nose above the
surface of the surrounding fluid. Make no efforts, but wait
tranquilly until succor arrives. You cannot sink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4003. 3. Do not lay hold of your companion or assistant, or
you will infallibly sink him without benefiting yourself. The
best swimmer has no more natural buoyancy than you, and
would be sunk by the exertion of very little force.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4004. 4. Remain perfectly passive till your helper seizes you
by the hair. Upon this endeavor to second his efforts by
throwing yourself on your back. Hold your neck stiff, and
let the back of your head sink into the water. Try to propel
yourself at this stage by regularly and slowly kicking against
the water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4005. 5. Be careful to keep every part of your body except
your face under the water. 6. If two or more persons are
immersed together, let them keep near to each other. By this
means one boat may save the whole party at once; but if they
are dispersed, one at a time only can be picked up.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4006. <em>Rules to Govern Persons who Attempt to Rescue the
Drowning.</em>&mdash;1. In removing a body from the water, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
into a boat or drawing it along by your own efforts, always
keep the face upward.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4007. 2. Recollect that you have no more buoyancy than
the person you are attempting to rescue. Therefore do not
attempt to raise him out of the water, or you will sink. By a
gentle traction, you may draw him toward the boat or landing-place
without fatigue or danger.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4008. 3. Always aim at seizing the hind hair of the head,
and keep the nape of the neck and your own arm under the
water. Thus you will insure his face and your own being
above the surface.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4009. 4. Keep your most powerful arm disengaged for
swimming, and maintain the other projected forward, having
hold, as directed, by the hind hair of the head. In this way
you may advance side by side, he floating on his back, and
you on your breast.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4010. 5. As you approach the person distressed, let him
know by your voice; the prospect of his speedy succor will
add to his confidence and strength.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4011. 6. Let all your movements be deliberate, firm, and
gentle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4012. 7. Hold the hat reversed in both hands, the arms and
hands of course under water. If a person has presence of
mind to accomplish this, the hat will by its buoyancy afford
him great assistance, until it becomes saturated and admits
the water.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4013. <em>Riding.</em>&mdash;To ride well on horseback is a healthful
and very graceful accomplishment for a lady or gentleman.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4014. <em>Dress.</em>&mdash;The lady's riding dress should be of a
material that rain will not spoil, made to fit easily, and by no
means tight.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4015. <em>The length</em> should not exceed an ordinary dress more
than from <em>fourteen</em> to <em>eighteen inches</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4016. <em>To keep the front</em> of the dress down, sew small
quantities of shot in bits of muslin, tack these around the inside
of the front breadth of the skirt, at equal distances.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4017. <em>The Hat</em> or cap should be as light as possible. Tie
on securely.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4018. Have no loose ribbons or strings flying about your
cap or dress to frighten the horses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4019. Fasten your hair up securely, and do not blind your
eyes with curls.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4020. <em>Gloves</em> should be of a kind that will permit you to
handle the reins easily.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4021. <em>Ride slowly.</em>&mdash;The true secret of learning to ride well
is to ride slowly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4022. <em>Always ride slowly</em> when you start, and when returning,
you are near home.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4023. <em>Ride slowly</em> up hill and down hill. Let the reins be
slack when ascending; tighten them as you descend.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4024. <em>Speak gently</em> to your horse; pat his neck, and show
kindness to him; it is the surest and safest mode of management.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4025. <em>In crossing</em> a river, if the horse should have to swim,
be sure to let the rains fall loose. Do not attempt to hold up
his head, he cannot swim if you do.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4026. <em>On which side</em> of a lady should a gentleman ride?&mdash;is
often asked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4027. <em>On the left.</em>&mdash;He can then protect and assist the lady
much more advantageously than he would if riding on the
right side of her horse.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4028. <em>A lady's horse</em> should be fifteen or fifteen and a half
hands high. <em>A hand is four inches.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4029. <em>How to judge a Horse.</em>&mdash;If the color be light sorrel,
or chestnut, his feet, legs, and face white, these are marks of
kindness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4030. If he is broad and full between the eyes, he may be
depended on as a horse of good sense, and capable of being
trained to any thing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4031. As respects such horses, the more kindly you treat
them the better you will be treated in return. Nor will a
horse of this description stand a whip, if well fed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4032. If you want a safe horse, avoid one that is dish-faced.
He may be so far gentle as not to scare; but he will have too
much go-ahead in him to be safe with everybody.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4033. If you want one that will never give out, never buy
a large, overgrown one.&mdash;(See pages <a href="#Page_198">198</a>, <a href="#Page_199">199</a>.)</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>HOME COUNSELS.</h4>

<p>4034. <em>Prudence.</em>&mdash;The great end of prudence is to give
cheerfulness to those hours which splendor cannot gild, and
acclamation cannot exhilarate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4035. <em>To be happy at home</em> is the ultimate result of all
ambition; the end to which every enterprise and labor tends,
and of which every desire prompts the prosecution.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4036. It is indeed, at home that every man and woman
must be known, by those who would make a just estimate of
his virtue or felicity; for smiles and embroidery are alike,
occasional, and the mind is often dressed for show in painted
honor and fictitious benevolence.&mdash;<em>Dr. Johnson.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4037. <em>Reading</em> aloud, speaking, and particularly singing,
affords a healthful exercise; while wind-instruments are injurious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4038. To young ladies the habit of reading aloud has much
to recommend it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4039. <em>As mere exercise</em>, it is highly beneficial on account
of the strength and vigor which it confers on the chest and
lungs; while the mental pleasure derived therefrom is one of
the most delightful that can adorn the family circle.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4040. Gathered around the winter's fire, or evening lamp,
what could be more cheerful for the aged and infirm, what
more instructive to the younger branches, or more exemplary
to the careless, than the reading aloud of some entertaining
author.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4041. Were females of all ranks to adopt the practice more
than they do at present, they would bind to their homes many
who are disposed to go in search of unworthy enjoyments, and
would add another chain of delightful associations, wherewith
to attach the young to the family hearth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4042. Fatuity from old age cannot be cured; but may be
prevented by employing the mind constantly in reading and in
conversation in the evening of life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4043. <em>A Word to the Young.</em>&mdash;-Never be cast down by trifles.
If a spider breaks his thread twenty times, twenty times will
he mend it again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4044. Make up your minds to do a thing and you will do
it. Fear not if a trouble comes upon you; keep up your
spirits, though the day be a dark one.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4045. If the sun is going down, look up to the stars. If
the earth is dark, keep your eye on Heaven! With God's
promises, a man or child may be cheerful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4046. Mind what you run after! Never be content with a
bubble that will burst, firewood that will end in smoke and
darkness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4047. Get that which you can keep, and which is worth
keeping. Fight hard against a hasty temper. Anger will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
come, but resist it strongly. A fit of passion may give you
cause to mourn all the days of your life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4048. Never revenge an injury. If you have an enemy, act
kindly to him and make him your friend. You may not win
him over at once, but try again. Let one kindness be followed
by another, till you have compassed your end. By little and
little, great things are completed; and repeated kindness will
soften a heart of stone.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4049. Whatever you do, do it willingly. A boy that is
whipped to school never learns his lessons well. A man who
is compelled to work cares not how badly it is performed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4050. He that pulls off his coat cheerfully, strips up his
sleeves in earnest, and sings while he works, is the man of
action.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4051. <em>The Voice.</em>&mdash;In ordinary conversation, the modulation
and proper management of the voice is a point worthy
of the attention of young ladies; for a fine and melodious
voice, "sweet as music on the waters," makes the heart-strings
vibrate to the very core.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4052. The thin, small voice is the most difficult to manage,
as it is liable to degenerate into shrillness; and ladies who
have this kind of voice must keep strict guard over their
temper, when within hearing of any one on whom they may
wish to make a favorable impression; for the very idea of a
shrill-voiced scold makes us place our hands to our ears.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4053. But with a sweet temper, a pretty little harmonious
voice is pleasing enough. Always recollect, however, that
affectation, constraint, or striving for effect, is the certain ruin
of the prettiest voice in the world.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4054. <em>Utility of Singing.</em>&mdash;It is asserted, and we believe
with some truth, that singing is a corrective of the too common
tendency to pulmonic complaints.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4055. Dr. Rush, an eminent physician, observes on this
subject:&mdash;The Germans are seldom afflicted with consumption;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
and this, I believe, is in part occasioned by the strength which
their lungs acquire by exercising them in vocal music, for this
constitutes an essential branch of their education.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4056. The music master of an academy has furnished a remark
still more in favor of this opinion. He had known
several instances of persons who were strongly disposed to
consumption, who were restored to health by the exercise of
their lungs in singing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4057. <em>Music.</em>&mdash;Had I children, my utmost endeavor should
be to teach them music. Considering I have no ear, nor ever
thought of music, the preference seems odd, and yet it is embraced
on frequent reflection. In short, my aim would be to
make them happy. I think it the most probable method.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4058. <em>Music</em> is a resource which will last them their lives
unless they grow deaf; it depends upon themselves, not on
others; always amuses and soothes, if not consoles; and of
all fashionable pleasures, it is the cheapest. It is capable of
fame, without the danger of criticism; is susceptible of enthusiasm,
and is sure of being gratified in Heaven.&mdash;<em>Horace
Walpole.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4059. <em>Spectacles&mdash;Use of.</em>&mdash;The following rules will enable
any one to judge whether his eye-sight may be assisted or
preserved by the use of glasses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4060. When we are obliged to remove small objects to a
distance from the eye to see them distinctly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4061. If we need more light than formerly, as, for instance,
if we place the candle between the eye and the object.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4062. If, on attentively considering a neat object, it fatigues
the eye, and becomes confused, or has a kind of mist before it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4063. When small printed letters seem to run into each
other, and, by looking steadfastly on them, appear double or
treble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4064. If the eyes are so fatigued by a little exercise, that
we are obliged to shut them from time to time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4065. When these circumstances occur, either separately
or together, glasses should be immediately resorted to; otherwise
the sight will be liable to be injured by the constant effort
required.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>PARLOR AMUSEMENTS.</h4>

<p>4066. <em>Riddles.</em>&mdash;It may be asked, What is a riddle? Ah!
what is it? That's just the rub! Well, then, it is a queer
affair, without shape, size, humanity, compassion, breath, or
sex. It is caressed, abused, courted, slighted, jostled, hustled,
and, notwithstanding all that is said against it, universally
looked upon as a welcome guest when it is not in a dull mood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4067. The oldest riddle on record is that put forth by Samson
(Judges xiv.)&mdash;"Out of the eater came forth meat, and
out of the strong came forth sweetness." His solution is well
known, as it is explained in the same chapter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4068. <em>M. Voltaire's Riddle.</em>&mdash;What is the longest, and yet
the shortest thing in the world; the swiftest and the most
slow; the most divisible and the most extended; the least
valued, and the most regretted; without which nothing can be
done; which devours every thing, however small, and yet gives
life and spirit to all things however great? Answer&mdash;Time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4069. Enigmas may be founded upon simple catches, like
conundrums, in which form they are usually called Riddles,
such as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though you set me on foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"> &nbsp; I shall be on my head."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>4070. The answer is, <em>A nail in a shoe</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4071. <em>Ancient Enigma.</em>&mdash;The ancients fabled a monster
whom they named the <span class="smcap">Sphinx</span>, and whom they described as
having the head and breasts of a woman, the body of a dog,
the tail of a serpent, the wings of a bird, the paws of a lion,
and a human voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4072. This monster, it was said, was sent into the neighborhood
of Thebes by Juno, who wished to punish the family of
Cadmus. It was further stated, that he laid this part of
Bœotia under continual alarms, <em>by proposing enigmas</em>, and
devouring the inhabitants if unable to explain them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4073. Also, that as the calamity of this monster was become
an object of public concern, and as the successful explanation
of an enigma would end in the death of the Sphinx, Creon
promised his crown and Jocasta to him who succeeded in the
attempt.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4074. The enigma proposed was this:&mdash;<br />
"What animal in the morning walks on four feet, at noon
on two, and in the evening on three?"</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4075. Œdipus solved the enigma&mdash;on which the monster
dashed his head against a rock, and perished.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4076. Answer&mdash;<span class="smcap">Man</span>; in the <em>morning</em>, or days of infancy,
he crawls, or walks on all-<em>fours</em>; at <em>noon</em>, or in the days of
youth and middle age, he uses <em>two</em> feet only; in the <em>evening</em>,
or in his old age, he requires the support of a staff, so that he
may be said to walk upon <em>three</em> feet.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4077. <em>Puzzles</em> vary very much. One of the simplest that
we know is this:&mdash;Take away half of <em>thirteen</em>, and let <em>eight</em>
remain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4078. Write XIII on a slate, or on a piece of paper&mdash;rub
out the lower half of the figures, and VIII will remain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4079. What are termed "practical puzzles" are cut out of
wood, cardboard, ivory, &amp;c., and may be purchased at the
toyshops.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4080. <em>The three Jealous Husbands.</em>&mdash;This is a very ingenious
puzzle, and should be performed with small counters of
two different colors.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4081. Three jealous husbands, with their wives, having to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
cross a small stream, find a boat without an owner, which is
only sufficiently large to carry two persons at a time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4082. Wanted to know,&mdash;how the six persons can transport
themselves over the river in pairs, so that no woman shall be left
in company with any of the men unless her husband is present.</p>

<p>4083. <em>Answer.</em>&mdash;At first two wives cross the river, then one
returns and takes over the remaining wife; after which she recrosses,
and stays with her husband, and the two husbands
cross over. Then a husband and wife come back, and the two
husbands cross. Then the wife returns and takes over one of
the others, and lastly the husband of the remaining one comes
back for his wife.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4084. <em>Arithmetical Puzzle.</em>&mdash;Arrange the figures 1 to 9 in
such order that, by adding them together, they amount to 100.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">36</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">47</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">It is done thus:&mdash; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ndash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">98</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">2</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">&ndash;&mdash; </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">100</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>4085. <em>The Charade</em> is a poetical or other composition
founded upon a word, each syllable of which constitutes a
<em>noun</em>, and the whole of which word constitutes another noun,
of somewhat a different meaning from those supplied, by its
separate syllables.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4086. Words which fully answer these conditions are the
best for the purposes of charades; though many other words
are employed.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4087. In writing, the first syllable is termed "<em>My first</em>,"
the second syllable, "<em>My second</em>," and the complete word,
"<em>My whole</em>."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4088. <em>Charade.</em>&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>4089. <em>Answer.</em>&mdash;Sparrow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4090. <em>Ventriloquism.</em>&mdash;The main secret of ventriloquism
simply consists in first making a strong and deep inspiration,
by which a considerable quantity of air is introduced into the
lungs, to be afterward acted upon by the flexible powers of the
larynx, or cavity situated behind the tongue and the windpipe;
thus prepared, the expiration should be slow and gradual.
Any person, by practice can, therefore, obtain more or less
expertness in this exercise, in which, though not apparently,
the voice is still modified by the mouth and tongue; and it is
in the concealment of this aid that much of the perfection of
ventriloquism lies.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4091. <em>Curious Facts.</em>&mdash;If a tallow candle be placed in a
gun and be shot at a door, it will go through without sustaining
any injury; and if a musket-ball be fired into water, it will
rebound and be flattened as if fired against any hard substance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4092. A musket-ball may be fired through a pane of glass,
and if the glass be suspended by a thread it will make no difference,
and the thread not even vibrate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4093. <em>The Author.</em>&mdash;If you would write to any purpose,
you must be perfectly free from without, in the first place, and
yet more free from within.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4094. Give yourself the natural rein; think on no pattern,
no patron, no paper, no press, no public; think on nothing,
but follow your own impulses.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4095. Give yourself as you are, what you are, and how you
see it. Every man sees with his own eyes, or does not see at
all. This is incontrovertibly true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4096. Bring out what you have. If you have nothing, be
an honest beggar rather than a respectable thief.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4097. <em>Letter-writing.</em>&mdash;Great care and attention should be
devoted to epistolary correspondence, as nothing exhibits
want of taste and judgment so much as a slovenly letter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4098. <em>Postage.</em>&mdash;Since the establishment of the cheap
postage it is recognized as a rule that all letters should be prepaid;
indeed, many persons make it a point of never taking in
an unpaid letter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4099. Always put a stamp on your envelope at the top of
the right-hand corner.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4100. Let the direction be written very plain; this will save
the postman trouble, and facilitate business by preventing
mistakes.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4101. At the head of your letter, in the right-hand corner,
put your address in full, with the day of the month underneath;
do not omit this, though you may be writing to your most intimate
friend three or four times a day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4102. What you have to say in your letter, say as plainly
as possible, as if you were speaking; this is the best rule; do
not revert three or four times to one circumstance, but finish
up as you go on.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4103. Let your signature be written as plainly as possible
(many mistakes will be avoided, especially in writing to
strangers) and without any flourishes, as they tend not to add
in any way to the harmony of your letter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4104. A letter of introduction is to be enclosed in an <em>unsealed</em>
envelope.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4105. In writing notes of invitation, adhere to the old
forms, never use any unusual phrase or flourish about it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4106. In letters of ceremony employ the third person, thus,
"Mr. B. requests the honor of Mr. A.," &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4107. Romantic ladies are sentimental in their letters; the
warm-toned are passionate: both styles are bad; avoid them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4108. Never be guilty of falsehood by the pen; it is premeditated
sin, and seems worse than falsehood of speech.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4109. Use no preamble in your letters, come at once to the
point, state what you have to state, and conclude.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4110. Neither sex should enter into long details, or give
vent to their feelings in letters. They are always a standing
memorial for, or against&mdash;we must say generally against, for
it requires a peculiar talent to write a good letter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4111. If you write to a stranger for information, or on your
own business, fail not to send a stamped envelope with your
address, plainly written; this will not fail to procure you an
answer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4112. If you are not a good writer, it is advisable to use
the best ink, the best paper, and the best pens, as, though they
may not alter the character of your handwriting, yet they will
assist to make your writing look better.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4113. The paper on which you write should be clean, and
neatly folded.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4114. There should not be stains on the envelope; if otherwise,
it is only an indication of your own slovenliness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4115. Care should be taken in giving titled persons to whom
you write, their proper directions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4116. For a love letter, good paper is indispensable. When
it can be procured, that of a costly quality, gold-edged, perfumed,
or ornamented in the French style, may be properly
used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4117. The letter should be carefully enveloped, and nicely
sealed with a fancy wafer&mdash;not a common one, of course,
where any other can be had; or, what is better, plain or fancy
sealing-wax. As all persons are more or less governed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
first impressions and externals, the whole affair should be as
neat and elegant as possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4118. <em>Young ladies</em> should never engage in correspondence
with young gentlemen who are not near relations, unless with
the knowledge and consent of parents and guardians.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4119. <em>A young lady</em> should on no account correspond with
a <em>married man</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4120. <em>Letters of business</em> or inquiry may be sometimes
properly addressed by a young lady to a <em>married man</em>&mdash;but
when a correspondence becomes necessary, then write to the
<em>wife</em>, not the husband.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4121. <em>Dress of Children, etc.</em>&mdash;At home nothing can be
more foolish or more hurtful than to load a child with finery
which confines it, and which its every movement may destroy
and spoil. When at home or in the play-ground, the simplest
covering only is necessary, so that it be strong and warm.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4122. It is a vulgar error to suppose that children should
be left bare as to their legs, their chest, and arms, and that
men and women, who are so much stronger, should be covered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4123. The truth is, that more children die through the
stupidity of their parents in this respect, than from any single
disease which can be mentioned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4124. "I am certain," says a great medical authority, "that
half the deaths of children in the middle and upper classes of
society is to be attributed to the vanity and ignorance of their
parents.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4125. "I never see a poor child dressed as a young Highlander,
or in any fancy dress, with its uncomfortable look and
naked appearance, its poor bare knees and open neck, but
I prophecy for that child, whilst I pity, a future of colds,
coughs, and throat disease, and a probable death of consumption."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4126. Another important thing in the dress of children,
besides keeping them warmly clad, is to keep them well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
though loosely shod. The evils of a tight shoe or boot in a
grown-up person is ten times multiplied in a child.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4127. Splay-feet, knock-knees, or bandy-legs, are the consequence,
all of which the ignorant would certainly lay to
nature, though they are nothing but the production of an art
as cruel as it is ignorant, and which is entirely contrary to
beauty of Form, or to <span class="smcap">Good Taste</span>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4128. <em>High Shoulders.</em>&mdash;A medical correspondent of an
English paper attributes the high shoulder and the lateral
curvature of the spine, which so frequently disfigures young
girls, to the shoulder straps of their dresses resting below the
shoulder and on the muscles of the arm, instead of being on
the shoulder, which compels the wearer to be constantly
hitching her shoulders to keep up her dress, an action that
results in forcing up the shoulder, a distortion of the chest,
and a lateral curvature of the spine.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4129. He also states that from the dangerous practice, and
the consequent exposure of the chest to the cold, that inward
tubercles are formed, and not unfrequently consumption is
engendered.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4130. Sudden alterations of heat and cold are dangerous
especially to the young and the aged.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4131. <em>Therefore</em>, clothing, in quantity and quality, should
be adapted to the alternations of night and day, and of the
seasons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4132. <em>And therefore</em>, <em>also</em>, drinking cold water when the
body is hot, and hot tea and soups when cold, are productive
of many evils.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4133. A bed-room, or nursery, ought to be spacious and
lofty, dry, airy, and not inhabited during the day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4134. No servants, if possible, should be suffered to sleep
in the same room; and no linen or washed clothes should ever
be hung there to dry, as they contaminate the air in which so
considerable a portion of infantine life must be spent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4135. The consequences attending a vitiated atmosphere in
such rooms are various, and often fatal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4136. Change of apparel greatly promotes the secretion
from the skin, so necessary to health.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4137. But no damp clothing should be worn, nor damp
linen put on the beds. Every thing should be well aired.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4138. Feather-beds should be banished from nurseries, as
they are an unnatural and debilitating contrivance.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4139. The windows should seldom be opened at night, but
left open the whole day, in fine, clear weather. A door into
the sleeping room may be left open.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4140. Lastly, the bedstead must not be placed too low on
the floor; nor is it proper to let children sleep on a couch
which is made without any elevation from the ground; because
the most mephitic and pernicious stratum of air in an
apartment, is that within one or two feet from the floor, while
the most wholesome, or atmospheric air, is in the middle of
the room, and the inflammable gas ascends to the top.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4141. <em>The power of Kindness.</em>&mdash;Soft words soften the
soul.&mdash;Angry words are fuel to the flame of wrath, and make
it blaze more freely.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4142. Kind words make other people good-natured&mdash;cold
words freeze people, and hot words scorch them, and bitter
words make them bitter, and wrathful words make them
wrathful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4143. There is such a rush of all other kinds of words in
our days, that it seems desirable to give kind words a chance
among them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4144. There are vain words, and idle words, and hasty
words, and spiteful words, and silly words, and empty words,
and profane words, and boisterous words, and warlike words.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4145. Kind words also produce their own image on men's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
souls, and a beautiful image it is. They sooth, and quiet,
and comfort the hearer. They shame him out of his sour, and
morose, and unkind feelings. We have not yet begun to use
kind words in such abundance as they ought to be used.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4146. <em>Gossiping.</em>&mdash;If you wish to cultivate a gossiping,
meddling, censorious spirit in your children, be sure when they
come home from church, a visit, or any other place where you
do not accompany them, to ply them with questions concerning
what everybody wore, how everybody looked, and what everybody
said and did; and if you find any thing in this to censure,
always do it in their hearing.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4147. <em>Amusements for Children.</em>&mdash;These should be provided.
Children must play; a large portion of their waking
hours must be passed in action if we would make them healthy
and happy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4148. <em>School</em> and study should not occupy more than three
hours of the day, till the child is over ten years of age.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4149. <em>Out door</em> play is best for children when the season
and weather will permit.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4150. <em>In door</em>, one of the best exercises for children and
youth is <em>dancing</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4151. <em>Let your children learn to dance.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4152. <em>The abuse of the art</em> can be avoided, and its benefits
are great.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4153. <em>Terms used to describe the movements of dances</em>&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4154. <em>Balancez</em>&mdash;Set to partners.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4155. <em>Chaine Anglaise</em>&mdash;The top and bottom couples right
and left.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4156. <em>Chaine Anglaise double</em>&mdash;The right and left double.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4157. <em>Chaine des dames</em>&mdash;The ladies' chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4158. <em>Chaine des dames double</em>&mdash;The ladies' chain double,
which is performed by all the ladies commencing at the same
time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4159. <em>Chassez</em>&mdash;Move to the right and left.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4160. <em>Chassez croisez</em>&mdash;Gentlemen change places with partners,
and back again.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4161. <em>Demie Chaine Anglaise</em>&mdash;The four opposite persons
half right and left.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4162. <em>Demie Promenade</em>&mdash;All eight half promenade.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4163. <em>Dos-à-dos</em>&mdash;The two opposite persons pass round
each other.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4164. <em>Demie Moulinet</em>&mdash;The ladies all advance to the centre,
giving hands and return to places.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4165. <em>La grand chaine</em>&mdash;All eight chassez quite round,
giving alternately right and left hands to partners, beginning
with the right.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4166. <em>Le grand rond</em>&mdash;All join hands and advance and
retire twice.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4167. <em>Pas d'Allemande</em>&mdash;The gentlemen turn the partners
under their arms.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4168. <em>Traversez</em>&mdash;The two opposite persons change places.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4169. <em>Vis-à-vis</em>&mdash;The opposite partner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4170. <em>La Galopade</em>&mdash;Is an extremely graceful and spirited
dance in a continual chassez. An unlimited number may join;
it is danced in couples as waltzing. This is a pretty dance
for children.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>THE TRAINING OF DAUGHTERS, ETC.</h4>

<p>4171. Make them religious; the foundation of all excellence
is in true piety of the heart.</p>

<p>Mothers, who wish not only to discharge well their own
duties in the domestic circle, but to train up their daughters
at a later day to make happy and comfortable firesides for
their families, should watch well, and guard well, the notions
which they imbibe, and with which they grow up.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4172. One main falsity abroad in this age is the notion, that
women, unless compelled to it by absolute poverty, are out of
place when engaged in domestic affairs.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4173. Let mothers avoid such danger. If they would do
so, they must bring up their daughters from the first with the
idea that in this world it is required to give as well as to
receive, to minister as well as to enjoy; that every person is
bound to be useful, practically, literally useful, in his or her
sphere.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4174. <em>Woman's sphere</em> is the house&mdash;her home; its concerns
and demands: these are her first duties.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4175. Once really imbued with this belief, and taught to see
how much the happiness of woman herself, as well as her family,
depends on this part of her discharge of duty, a young girl
will usually be anxious to learn all that her mother is disposed
to teach.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4176. She will be proud and happy to aid in any domestic
occupations assigned to her, which need never be made so
heavy as to interfere with the peculiar duties of her age, or its
peculiar delights.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4177. If a mother wishes to see her daughter become a
good, happy, and rational woman, never let her admit of contempt
for domestic occupations, or even suffer them to be
deemed secondary. They may be varied in character by
station, but they can never be secondary to a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4178. Therefore teach your daughters to keep accounts, so
that they may learn the value of money.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4179. <em>Teach them to work</em>, that they may not waste their
time if rich, nor be helpless if poor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4180. <em>Teach them cooking</em>, that they may guard against
the waste of servants, and be able to help themselves and
others, if necessary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4181. <em>Educate the mind</em>, refine the taste, and exalt the
character, by keeping the love of excellence, in all they do,
before them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4182. Then they will be fitted to shine in domestic and
social life, and to understand Literature, Art, and Science,
as these conduce to goodness and happiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4183. <em>The Mother at Home.</em>&mdash;By the quiet fireside at home,
the true mother, in the midst of her children, is sowing as in
the vases of the earth, the seeds of plants that shall some time
give to Heaven the fragrance of their blossoms, and whose
fruit shall be to us a rosary of angelic deeds, the noblest offering
that she can make through the ever ascending and expanding
souls of her children to her Maker.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4184. Every word that she utters goes from heart to heart
with a power of which she little dreams. Philosophers tell us
in their speculations that we cannot lift a finger without moving
distant spheres.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4185. Solemn is the thought that every word that falls from
a mother's lip, every expression of her countenance, may leave
an indelible impress upon the young souls about her, and form
the underlaying strain of that education which peoples Heaven
with celestial beings, and gives to the white brow of the angel,
next to the grace of God, its crown of glory.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4186. <em>Teach your Children Obedience.</em></p>

<p>It is unspeakable what a blessing it is to a child, what
a saving of unhappiness and wickedness in after life, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
be early taught absolute obedience; there must be no hesitating
or asking why, but what a mother says must at once be
done.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4187. The young twig bends easily, but remember, that in
after years it grows hard, and will break before you bend it.
A little steadiness at first will save you many years' sorrow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4188. While you insist upon obedience, however, you must
take care that you do not provoke a child, and tempt it to disobedience
by unreasonable and foolish commands.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4189. "Provoke not your children to wrath;" and when it
is necessary to punish them, see that it never be done violently
and in a passion, but as a duty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4190. <em>Going in Debt.</em>&mdash;A <em>lady</em> should never go in debt,
unless she is <em>sure</em> of having the means of payment.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4191. <em>Shopping.</em>&mdash;Never go shopping for amusement&mdash;you
rob the shopkeeper of his time and waste your own.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4192. <em>A young lady</em> at home can find or make pleasant
amusements; one of the most healthful is the study of botany
or flowers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4193. <em>A garden</em>, or rather the fields and woods, will be filled
with new interest if you love the flowers, and can read their
history.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4194. <em>The language of flowers</em> has been studied and
arranged by the people of the East. A few specimens of this
may be admitted here, as an amusement for those who are idle
or curious.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>SENTIMENTS OF FLOWERS.</h4>

<p>4195. What each flower enumerated signifies when sent to
a friend or lover.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4196. <em>Almond, flowering</em>&mdash;Concealed love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4197. <em>Althea, Frutex</em>&mdash;I am deeply in love.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4198. <em>Amaranth</em>&mdash;Immortality, or piety.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<p>4206. <em>Box</em>&mdash;I believe in your constancy.</p>

<p>4219. <em>Fox-glove</em>&mdash;Insincerity. You are false.</p>

<p>4225. <em>Heliotrope</em>&mdash;Devotion. Let us pray for each other.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4226. <em>Hellebore</em>&mdash;Calumny. You have listened.</p>

<p>4227. <em>Hollyhock</em>&mdash;Ambition. I seek glory.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<hr class="r10" />

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4256. <em>Violet</em>&mdash;I dream of thee.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4257. <em>Willow</em>&mdash;Forsaken&mdash;never more.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4258. <em>Wheat</em>&mdash;Prosperity&mdash;I wish thee.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4259. <em>Yew</em>&mdash;Penitence. I am sorry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4260. <em>Poisonous Plants.</em>&mdash;Plants with five stamens and one
pistil, with a dull-colored lurid carolla, and a nauseous sickly
smell, are always poisonous. As <em>tobacco</em>, <em>henbane</em>, <em>nightshade</em>,
<em>thorn-apple</em>.</p>

<p>Umbelliferous plants of the aquatic kind, and with a
nauseous scent, are always poisonous. As <em>water-hemlock</em>,
<em>cow-parsley</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4261. Plants with <em>labiate</em> corollas and seeds in capsules, are
frequently poisonous. As <em>snap-dragon</em>, <em>fox-glove</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4262. Plants from which issue a milky juice on being broken,
are poisonous, unless they bear compound flowers. As
<em>milk-weed</em>, <em>dogbane</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4263. Plants having any appendage to the calyx or corolla,
and eight or more stamens, are generally poisonous. As <em>columbine</em>,
<em><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: 'nasturtion'">nasturtium</span></em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4264. Plants having twelve or more stamens, and a nauseous
sickly smell, are generally poisonous.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4265. <em>To ascertain the Length of the Day and Night.</em>&mdash;At
any time of the years add twelve hours to the time of the sun's
setting, and from the sum subtract the time of rising, for the
<em>length of the day</em>. Subtract the time of setting from twelve
hours, and to the remainder add the time of rising next morning,
for the <em>length of the night</em>. These rules are equally true
for <em>apparent</em> time.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4266. <em>Leap Year.</em>&mdash;Leap years are those that are exactly
divisible by four, and also by 400, and not by 100. The year
1900, therefore, will not be a leap year.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: '4266. (duplicate)'">4267.</span> <em>True Time.</em>&mdash;Two kinds of time are used in Almanacs;
<em>clock</em> or <em>mean time</em> in some, and <em>apparent</em> or <em>sun time</em>
in others. <em>Clock</em> time is always <em>right</em>, while <em>sun</em> time <em>varies</em>
every day. People generally suppose it is twelve o'clock when
the sun is due south, or at a properly made noon-mark. But
this is a mistake. The sun is seldom on the meridian <em>at twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
o'clock</em>; indeed this is the case only on four days of the year:
namely, April 15, June 15, September 1, and December 24.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4268. The time when the sun is on the meridian or at the
noon-mark is also given to the nearest second, for every day
in the year. This affords a ready means of obtaining correct
time and for setting a clock by using a noon-mark, adding or
subtracting as the sun is slow or fast.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4269. Old-fashioned Almanacs, which use <em>apparent</em> time,
give the rising and setting of the sun's <em>centre</em>, and make no
allowance for the effect of refraction of the sun's rays by the
atmosphere. The more modern and improved Almanacs,
which use <em>clock</em> time, give the rising and the setting of the
sun's <em>upper limb</em>, and duly allow for refraction.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4270. <em>Velocity of Sound and Light.</em>&mdash;Sound moves about
thirteen miles in a minute. So that if we hear a clap of
thunder half a minute after the flash, we may calculate that
the discharge of electricity is six and a half miles off.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4271. In one second of time&mdash;in one beat of the pendulum
of a clock&mdash;light travels over 192,000 miles. Were a cannon
ball shot toward the sun, and it were to maintain full speed, it
would be twenty years in reaching it&mdash;and yet light travels
through this space in seven or eight minutes.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>SIGNS OF THE WEATHER.</h4>

<p>4272. <em>Dew.</em>&mdash;If the dew lies plentifully on the grass after a
fair day, it is a sign of another. If not, and there is no wind,
rain must follow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4273. A red evening portends fine weather; but if it
spreads too far upward from the horizon in the evening, and
especially in the morning, it foretells wind or rain, or both.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4274. When the sky, in rainy weather, is tinged with sea-green,
the rain will increase; if with deep blue, it will be
showery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4275. <em>Clouds.</em>&mdash;Against much rain, the clouds grow bigger,
and increase very fast, especially before thunder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4276. When the clouds are formed like fleeces, but dense
in the middle and bright toward the edges, with the sky
bright, they are signs of a frost, with hail, snow, or rain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4277. If clouds form high in the air, in thin white trains
like locks of wool, they portend wind, and probably rain.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4278. When a general cloudiness covers the sky, and small
black fragments of clouds fly underneath, they are a sure sign
of rain, and probably it will be lasting. Two currents of
clouds always portend rain, and, in summer, thunder.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4279. <em>Heavenly Bodies.</em>&mdash;A haziness in the air, which fades
the sun's light, and makes the orb appear whitish, or ill-defined&mdash;or
at night, if the moon and stars grow dim, and a ring
encircles the former, rain will follow.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4280. If the sun's rays appear like Moses' horns&mdash;if white
at setting, or shorn of his rays, or goes down into a bank of
clouds in the horizon, bad weather is to be expected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4281. If the moon looks pale and dim we expect rain; if
red, wind; and if of her natural color, with a clear sky, fair
weather. If the moon is rainy throughout, it will be clear at
the change, and perhaps the rain return a few days after. If
fair throughout, and rain at the change, the fair weather will
probably return on the fourth or fifth day.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4282. <em>The Weather and the Blood.</em>&mdash;In dry, sultry weather
the heat ought to be counteracted by means of a cooling diet.
To this purpose, cucumbers, melons, and juicy fruit are subservient.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4283. We ought to give the preference to such alimentary
substances as lead to contract the juices which are too much
expanded by the heat, and the property is possessed by all
acid food and drink.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4284. To this class belong all sorts of salad, lemons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
oranges, pomegranates sliced and sprinkled with sugar, for the
acid of this fruit is not so apt to derange the stomach as that
of lemons; also cherries and strawberries, curds turned with
lemon acid or cream of tartar; cream of tartar dissolved in
water&mdash;lemonade and Rhenish or Moselle wine mixed with
water.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>AIR&mdash;ITS EFFECTS ON LIFE.</h4>

<p>4285. What is carbonic acid gas?</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4286. A gas formed by the union of carbon and oxygen.
It used to be called "fixed air."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4287. Under what circumstances does carbon most readily
unite with oxygen?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4288. 1. When its temperature is raised: thus, if carbon
be red-hot, oxygen will most readily unite with it; and 2.
When it forms part of the fluid blood.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4289. Why do oxygen and carbon so readily unite in the
blood?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4290. Because the atoms of carbon are so loosely attracted
by the other materials of the blood, that they unite very
readily with the oxygen of the air inhaled.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4291. Is carbonic acid wholesome?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4292. No: it is fatal to animal life: and (whenever it is inhaled)
acts like a narcotic poison&mdash;producing drowsiness,
which sometimes ends in death.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4293. How can any one know if a place be infested with
carbonic acid gas?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4294. If a pit or well contain carbonic acid, a candle (let
down into it) will be instantly extinguished. The rule, therefore,
is this&mdash;Where a candle will burn, a man can live; but
what will extinguish a candle, will also destroy life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4295. Why does a miner lower a candle into a mine before
he descends?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4296. Because the candle will be extinguished, if the mine
contains carbonic acid gas; but if the candle is not extinguished,
the mine is safe, and the man may fearlessly descend.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4297. Why does a crowded room produce headache?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4298. Because we breathe the air vitiated by the crowd.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4299. Why is the air of a room vitiated by a crowd?</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4300. Because it is deprived of its due proportion of oxygen,
and laden with carbonic acid.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4301. How is the air of a room affected thus by a crowd?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4302. The elements of the air (inhaled by the breath) are
separated in the lungs;&mdash;the oxygen is converted in the blood
into carbonic acid; and the carbonic acid (together with the
nitrogen) is then thrown off by the breath into the room.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4303. Why is country air more pure than the air in cities?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4304. 1. Because there are fewer inhabitants to vitiate the
air: 2. There are more trees to restore the equilibrium of the
vitiated air: and 3. The free circulation of air keeps it pure
and wholesome; in the same way as running streams are pure
and wholesome, while stagnant waters are the contrary.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4305. Why does the scantiness of a country population
render the country air more pure?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4306. Because the fewer the inhabitants the less carbonic
acid will be exhaled; and thus country people inhale pure
oxygen, instead of air impregnated with the narcotic poison,
called carbonic acid gas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4307. Why do trees and flowers help to make country air
wholesome?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4308. 1. Because trees and flowers absorb the carbonic
acid generated by the lungs of animals, putrid substances, and
other noxious exhalations: and 2. Trees and flowers restore
to the air the oxygen which has been inhaled by man and
other animals.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4309. Why is the air of cities less wholesome than the
country air?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4310. 1. Because there are more inhabitants to vitiate the
air: 2. The sewers, drains, bins, and filth of a city, very
greatly vitiate the air: 3. The streets and alleys prevent a
free circulation: and 4. Besides all this, there are fewer trees
to absorb the excess of carbonic acid gas, and restore the
equilibrium.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4311. Why are persons who live in close rooms and crowded
cities generally sickly?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4312. Because the air they breathe is not pure, but is (in
the first place) defective in oxygen: and (in the second) impregnated
with carbonic acid gas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4313. Where does the carbonic acid of close rooms and
cities come from?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4314. From the lungs of the inhabitants, the sewers, drains,
and other like places, in which organic substances are undergoing
decomposition.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4315. What becomes of the carbonic acid of crowded
cities?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4316. Some of it is absorbed by vegetables; and the rest
is blown away by the wind, and diffused through the whole
volume of the air.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4317. Does not this constant diffusion of carbonic acid
affect the purity of the whole air?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4318. No; because it is wafted by the wind from place to
place, and absorbed in its passage by the vegetable world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4319. What is choke damp?</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4320. Carbonic acid gas accumulated at the bottom of wells
and pits, which renders them noxious, and often fatal to life.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4321. <em>Offensive Cesspools.</em>&mdash;Sulphate of zinc can be purchased
of any druggist, in the form of a salt, and a pound of
it dissolved in two pails of warm water and thrown into an
offensive cesspool, will soon deodorize it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4322. <em>Directions for Pruning Vines.</em>&mdash;In pruning always
cut upward, and in a sloping direction.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4323. Always leave an inch of blank wood beyond a
terminal bud, and let the cut be on the opposite side of the
bud.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4324. Prune so as to leave as few wounds as possible, and
let the surface of every cut be perfectly smooth.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4325. In cutting out an old branch, prune it even with the
parent limb, that the wound may heal quickly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4326. Prune so as to obtain the quantity of fruit desired on
the smallest number of shoots possible.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4327. Never prune in frosty weather, nor when a frost is
expected.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4328. Never prune in the months of March, April, or May;
pruning in either of these months causes bleeding, and occasions
thereby a wasteful and injurious expenditure of sap.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4329. Let the general autumnal pruning take place as soon
after the 1st of October as the gathering of the fruit will permit.
Lastly. Use a prying-knife of the best description;
and let it be, if possible, as sharp as a razor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4330. <em>Curious Properties of some Figures.</em>&mdash;To multiply
by 2 is the same as to multiply by 10 and divide by 5.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4331. Any number of figures you may wish to multiply by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
5, will give the same result if divided by 2&mdash;a much quicker
operation than the former; but you must remember to annex
a cipher to the answer where there is no remainder, and where
there is a remainder annex a 5 to the answer.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4332. Thus, multiply 464 by 5, the answer will be 2320;
divide the same number by 2, and you have 232, and as there
is no remainder you add a cipher. Now, take 357, and
multiply by 5&mdash;the answer is 1785. On dividing 357 by 2,
there is 178, and a remainder; you therefore place 5 at the
right of the line, and the result is again 1785.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4333. There is something more curious in the properties of
the number 9. Any number multiplied by 9 produces a sum
of figures which, added together, continually makes 9. For
example, all the first multiples of 9, as 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63,
72, 81, sum up 9 each. Each of them multiplied by any
number whatever produces a similar result; as 8 times 81 are
648, these added together make 18, 1 and 8 are 9. Multiply
648 by itself, the product is 419,904&mdash;the sum of these digits
is 27, 2 and 7 are 9. The rule is invariable.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4334. Take any number whatever and multiply it by 9; or
any multiple of 9, and the sum will consist of figures which,
added together, continually number 9. As 17 × 19 = 306, 6
and 3 are 9; 117 × 27 = 3159, the figures sum up 18, 8 and
1 are 9; 4591 × 72 = 330,552, the figures sum up 18, 8 and 1
are 9. Again, 87,363 × 54 = 4,717,422; added together, the
product is 27, or 2 and 7 are 9, and so always.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4335. <em>Technical terms relative to Books, Engravings, etc:</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4336. Books are distinguished according to the number of
pages in a sheet of the paper on which they are printed; as,
<em>two</em> leaves, four pages, <em>folio</em>; <em>four</em> leaves, eight pages, <em>quarto</em>,
or <em>4to.</em>; <em>eight</em> leaves, sixteen pages, <em>octavo</em>, or <em>8vo.</em>; <em>twelve</em>
leaves, twenty-four pages, <em>twelves</em>, <em>duodecimo</em>, or <em>12mo.</em>; <em>sixteen</em>
leaves, thirty-two pages, <em>sixteens</em>, or <em>16mo.</em>; <em>eighteen</em>
leaves, thirty-six pages, <em>octodecimo</em>, <em>eighteens</em>, or <em>18mo.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4337. The <em>size</em> of a book is determined by the size or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
designation of a sheet of the paper on which it is printed; as
<em>foolscap 4to.</em>, or <em>8vo.</em>; <em>post 8vo.</em>; <em>demy 8vo</em>; <em>royal 8vo.</em> &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4338. The letters A, B, C, D, &amp;c., and the letters and
figures, A 2, A 3, A 4, &amp;c., at the bottoms of the first, third,
fifth, seventh, &amp;c., pages of printed sheets, are marks for directing
the printer, bookseller, and bookbinder in collecting, collating,
folding and placing the sheets in proper order. These
marks are usually termed <em>signatures</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4339. When the page of a book is divided into two or more
parts by a line or lines, or blank spaces, running from the top
to the bottom, each division is called a <em>column</em>. This work
is printed in <em>columns</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4340. <em>Vignette</em> is a French term, designating the ornamental
engraving, without a border, which is sometimes placed in
the title-page of a book, at the head or termination of a chapter,
&amp;c.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4341. <em>Xylography</em> is the art of engraving upon wood;
<em>etching</em>, <em>mezzotinto</em>, <em>aquatinta</em>, are varieties of the art of engraving
upon copper. Until within these few years, copper and
wood were the substances employed by engravers for book
illustrations. For certain purposes, wood (box-wood) continues
in the highest repute: but copper has been in a great
measure superseded by steel, where a large number of impressions
is required.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4342. <em>Electrography</em> is a newly-discovered electrical process,
by which one copper plate may be expeditiously produced,
in <em>fac simile</em> from another.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4343. <em>Glyphography</em> is a somewhat similar process, by
which, through the action of the <em>voltaic battery</em>, plates may be
obtained from drawings, affording impressions <em>ad libitum</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4344. <em>Lithography</em> is the art of taking impressions from
drawings or writings made on prepared and highly-polished
calcareous stone.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4345. <em>Zincography</em> is an adaptation of the same principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
to plates of zinc. All these processes are now extensively
employed in the illustrations of books for various purposes.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h4>LAWS&mdash;IMPORTANCE OF LAWS.</h4>

<p>4346. Every citizen should earnestly and constantly bear in
mind the important fact, that his only safety for person, property,
liberty and life, is in the absolute supremacy of the constitution
and the laws.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4347. <em>Betting on Elections.</em>&mdash;This is an extensive and pernicious
evil, alike injurious to the citizen and to the purity of
elections. All are interested in its suppression; let all then
unite in getting up and presenting petitions to the several
State legislatures for the passage of a law similar to that introduced
into the Legislature of Missouri against betters and
stakeholders, and fining both to the amount of money or property
bet. Also punishing by fine any person who may publish
a bet, or assist in any way in making it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4348. A decision in Ohio makes proprietors of stages
responsible for passengers' baggage, notwithstanding their
caution of "All baggage at the risk of the owners."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4349. <em>A Non-resident.</em>&mdash;A person having a place of business
in a city or town, and boarding and lodging in another,
is a non-resident in his place of business.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4350. Titles of land derived under sales for taxes are
declared good by Supreme Court of Illinois.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4351. A salesman receiving a per centage is not thereby
constituted a partner.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4352. Breach of trust is where valuables are received in the
course of employment, for or in the name of the employer, and
embezzled; but if the valuables have come to the possession
of the employer, the offense is larceny.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4353. A husband is liable for goods furnished his wife, if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
from ill-treatment or other sufficient cause, she does not live
with him; but if she leave him from unjustifiable causes, he is
not liable even for necessaries, whether the tradesman knows
of such separation or not.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4354. Erasing or altering an endorsement on a note is
forgery.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4355. A town is liable for damages occasioned by any
obstruction placed on the road by human agency, and is bound
to make roads safe and convenient for travelers.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4356. <em>Common Carriers.</em>&mdash;The owners of a steamboat are
responsible to shippers of goods as common carriers. Common
carriers, if they make a wrong delivery, are responsible
for any loss.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4357. The owners of goods must have them properly marked,
and entered in carriers' books; and if he neglects to do it, he
must bear the loss.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4358. An account current rendered, and accepted without
objection being made in a reasonable time, precludes objection
afterward, and makes it a stated account.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4359. A will dictated and taken down in pencil only, and
signed by two witnesses, is valid, if deceased was in sound
mind when he gave the instructions.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4360. <em>Wills.</em>&mdash;A will is an instrument in writing, executed
in form of law, by which a person makes a disposition of his
property, to take effect after his death.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4361. A codicil is a supplement or addition to a will, and
by which the will is altered, explained or added to, but in no
case wholly revoked.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4362. A bequest to a subscribing of a will is void.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4363. Let every man about to make a will endeavor to
make it as concise as possible; and if he employs a lawyer,
agree to pay him, not by the length, but by the transaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
Let him keep in his mind that every trust or use he creates,
also creates the danger of a lawsuit. <em>Every will should be
dated on the day it is executed.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4364. It is also of the first importance that it should be
<em>prepared without blot or alteration, or erasure</em>, for it is an instrument
that may not come into operation for many years&mdash;of
a surety not until the party best capable of explaining it,
the testator himself, is removed from the scene of evidence,
and possibly not until both the writer of it, and the witnesses,
have either ceased to exist, or whose locality is not to be
traced.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4365. <em>Homestead Exemption.</em>&mdash;It has been truly, as well
as eloquently said, that "Women are the Corinthian pillars
that adorn and support society; the institutions that protect
women throw a shield also around children; and where women
and children are provided for, man must be secure in his
rights."</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4366. From this radical law of society, which makes the
best interests of humanity dependent on the integrity and
comfort of the Homes of the People, arises the necessity that
legislation should protect the sacredness, and insure the safety
of the places where women and children dwell. We hope that
every State in our broad land will take heed of this paramount
duty.</p>

<p>The following extracts exhibit the various qualifications
of the Homestead Exemption Laws now in force in the
several States named:&mdash;</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4367. <em>Maine.</em>&mdash;A lot of land, a dwelling-house, and out-buildings
thereon, or so much thereof as shall not exceed
$5000 in value.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4368. <em>Vermont.</em>&mdash;The homestead of every housekeeper, or
head of a family, to the value of $500, and the yearly products
thereof.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4369. <em>Massachusetts.</em>&mdash;The lot and buildings thereon occupied
as a residence, to the value of $5000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4370. <em>New York.</em>&mdash;The lot and buildings thereon occupied
as a residence, to the value of $5000.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4371. <em>Maryland.</em>&mdash;All real estate acquired by marriage
during the life of a wife, from execution for debt of husband.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4372. <em>Georgia.</em>&mdash;Twenty acres of land, including dwelling
and improvements, not to exceed $200; and the additional
amount of five acres for each child under fifteen years of age.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4373. <em>Florida.</em>&mdash;Forty acres of land, when not in any town
or city, and provided such does not exceed in value $400.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4374. <em>Alabama.</em>&mdash;Forty acres of land to every farmer; and
to every housekeeper, residing in a town or city, a house and
lot not to exceed $3000 in value.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4375. <em>Texas.</em>&mdash;Two hundred acres of land (when not in any
town lots), not to exceed $2000 in value.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4376. <em>Ohio.</em>&mdash;Every family a homestead not to exceed $500
in value.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4377. <em>Michigan.</em>&mdash;Forty acres, with dwelling-house and
appurtenance, when not in town or city; if in town or city, a
lot or dwelling-house not to exceed in value $1500.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4378. <em>Illinois.</em>&mdash;Lot of ground and building occupied as a
residence, not exceeding in value $1000.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4379. <em>Iowa.</em>&mdash;Forty acres of land, not in town or city, or
a town or city lot not exceeding in amount one-fourth of an
acre.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4380. <em>California.</em>&mdash;The homestead, consisting of a quantity
of land, together with the dwelling-house thereon and its
appurtenances, and not exceeding in value the sum of $5000.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4381. <em>New Jersey.</em>&mdash;A homestead to each head of a family,
being the family residence, to the value of $500; not to be
assets in the hands of an administrator, but to remain for the
benefit of the widow, and until the maturity of the minor child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4382. <em>South Carolina.</em>&mdash;A homestead of fifty acres of land,
including the dwelling-house and appurtenances, not to exceed
$500 in value, and to extend to any property situated within
the limits of any city or town corporate.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4383. <em>Arkansas</em> has an homestead exemption.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4384. <em>Pennsylvania.</em>&mdash;The amount of $300, in real or personal
property.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4385. Other States may have exemption laws, but I have
not found any record.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p><span class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: '4836.'">4386.</span> <em>Naturalization Laws.</em>&mdash;Congress alone has power to
make or regulate the laws of naturalization.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4387. An alien must renounce, in court, allegiance, &amp;c., to
any foreign power, and declare his intention of becoming a citizen
at least two years before admission. Must swear to support
the Constitution, renounce any hereditary title or order of
nobility, and must have resided five years in the country, and
satisfy the court that he has behaved as a man of good moral
character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the
United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness
of the same.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4388. Children of naturalized citizens, if under twenty-one
years of age at the time of their parents' naturalization, shall,
if dwelling in the United States, be considered as citizens.
An alien, having declared his intention, and dying before he
was naturalized, his widow and children, on taking the oaths
prescribed, shall be entitled to all the rights of citizenship.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4389. <em>Receipts.</em>&mdash;A receipt is not conclusive evidence of
payment, but it throws the burden of proof upon him who
attempts to impeach it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4390. Receipts may be either in full of all demands, for a
special account, in part payment of an account, or for a special
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4391. The arrangement of the wording of a receipt is not
important, if the object and time be distinctly stated in it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4392. A general receipt "in full of all demands" is a discharge
of all debts except special debts under seal.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4393. The legality of signatures in pencil has ever been
questioned.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4394. Account books, notes or receipts, written in pencil,
would not be respected in any law court.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4395. In those States in which exemption laws are enforced,
the drawer of a promissory note may expressly waive all right
of benefit from those laws. Conditions which the subscriber
may add to a "note of promise," if accepted by the receiver,
holds good in every State, unless they directly contravene
local laws.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<hr class="r10" />
<h4>PHRENOLOGY.</h4>

<p>4396. The word is derived from two Greek words, signifying
<em>mind</em> and <em>doctrine</em> or <em>discourse</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4397. <em>Phrenology</em> designates that system of mental philosophy
which treats of the special manifestation of minds.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4398. <em>Phrenology</em> teaches that the faculties of the mind
have, each one, its special organ or place in the brain; and
that these organs, in their aggregate, constitute the brain.
Therefore the brain is the organ of the mind.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4399. <em>Powers of Mind.</em>&mdash;These are manifested by the size
and developments of the brain&mdash;when temperament, health,
and opportunities are equal.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4400. The size of each organ measures the power of the
faculty which is exercised by means of it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4401. Each organ desires its own active gratification in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
proportion to its development, the larger controlling the
smaller.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4402. This is a brief outline of the science or study. The
general principles are, more or less, interwoven into our literature,
and influence our systems of education; therefore the
following may be found interesting and curious, if not useful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4403. <em>Heads</em>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-688.jpg" width="500" height="224" alt="The 35 regions of the brain" />
</div>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4404. <em>Faculties of the Mind.</em></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4405. <em>Of the Feelings or Affective Faculties</em>, usually styled
<em>propensities</em>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4406. <em>Alimentativeness</em>&mdash;Gives appetite for food. It has
been a question whether this organ was in the brain or the
stomach, therefore it is not numbered on the head.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4407. &nbsp; &nbsp;1. <em>Amativeness</em>&mdash;Produces sexual love, desire, physical
love.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4408. &nbsp; &nbsp;2. <em>Philoprogenitiveness</em>&mdash;Love of children and
young beings.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4409. &nbsp; &nbsp;3. <em>Concentrativeness</em>&mdash;Continues the mind on emotion
or ideas.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4410. &nbsp; &nbsp;4. <em>Adhesiveness</em>&mdash;Friendship, sociability, attachment
generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4411. &nbsp; &nbsp;5. <em>Combativeness</em>&mdash;Courage, opposition, intrepidity,
quarrelsomeness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4412. &nbsp; &nbsp;6. <em>Destructiveness</em>&mdash;Desire to destroy, torment;
harshness, cruelty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4413. &nbsp; &nbsp;7. <em>Secretiveness</em>&mdash;Concealment, prudence, cunning,
hypocrisy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4414. &nbsp; &nbsp;8. <em>Acquisitiveness</em>&mdash;Desire to acquire property;
avarice, selfishness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4415. &nbsp; &nbsp;9. <em>Constructiveness</em>&mdash;Mechanical genius, desire to
build.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<p class="pfs80">SENTIMENTS&mdash;INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR.</p>


<p>4416. &nbsp; &nbsp;10. <em>Self-Esteem</em>&mdash;Self-respect, personal dignity,
pride, haughtiness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4417. &nbsp; &nbsp;11. <em>Approbativeness</em>&mdash;Thirst for praise, fame, or
glory; ambition, vanity.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4418. &nbsp; &nbsp;12. <em>Cautiousness</em>&mdash;Circumspection, timidity, fear,
despondency.</p>


<hr class="r10" />

<h4>WORDS OF WASHINGTON.</h4>

<p>4491. The following rules were found among the early
papers of this great hero, patriot and statesman. He wrote
them when, probably, about fourteen or fifteen years of age.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4492. As these rules were a guide to him, evidently shown
in his life and character, so may they influence the conduct of
Young America.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4493. Rules of civility and decent behavior in company and
conversation, written by <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4494. Every action in company ought to be with some sign
of respect to those present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4495. Be no flatterer; neither play with any one that
delights not to be played with.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4496. Read no letters, books, or papers in company; but
when there is a necessity for doing it, you must ask leave.
Come not near the books or writings of any one so as to read
them, unless desired, nor give your opinion of them unasked;
also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4497. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious
matters somewhat grave.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4498. Show not yourself glad at the misfortune of another,
though he were your enemy.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4499. When you meet with one of greater quality than yourself,
stop and retire, especially if it be at a door or any strait
place, to give way for him to pass.</p>

    </div><div>

<hr class="r10" />
<p>4500. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all
places precedency; but whilst they are young they ought to
respect those that are their equals in birth, or other qualities,
though they have no public charge.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4501. It is good manners to prefer them to whom we speak
before ourselves, especially if they be above us, with whom in
no sort we ought to begin.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4502. Let your discourse with men of business be short
and comprehensive.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4503. In visiting the sick, do not presently play the physician,
if you be not knowing therein.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4504. In writing, or speaking, give to every person his due
title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4505. Strive not with your superiors in argument, but
always submit your judgment to others with modesty.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4506. Undertake not to teach your equal in the art he himself
professes; it savors of arrogance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4507. When a man does all he can, though it succeeds not
well, blame not him that did it.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4508. Being to advise or reprehend any one, consider
whether it ought to be in public or in private; presently or at
some other time; in what terms to do it; and in reproving
show no signs of choler, but do it with sweetness and mildness.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4509. Take all admonitions thankfully, in what time or
place soever given; but afterward, not being culpable, take a
time or place convenient to let him know it that gave them.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4510. Mock not, nor jest at any thing of importance; break
no jests that are sharp-biting; and if you deliver any thing
witty and pleasant, abstain from laughing thereat yourself.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4511. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself;
for example is more prevalent than precepts.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4512. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither
curse nor revile.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4513. Be not hasty to believe flying reports to the disparagement
of any.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4514. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate
nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the
fashion of your equals, such as are civil and orderly with
respect to times and places.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4515. Associate yourselves with men of good quality, if you
esteem your own reputation, for it is better to be alone than
in bad company.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4516. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a
secret.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4517. Utter not base or frivolous things amongst grave
and learned men; nor very difficult questions or subjects
among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4518. Speak not of doleful things in time of mirth, nor at
the table; speak not of melancholy things, as death, and
wounds; and if others mention them, change, if you can, the
discourse. Tell not your dreams but to your intimate friend.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4519. Break not a jest where none takes pleasure in mirth;
laugh not aloud, nor at all without occasion. Deride no man's
misfortune, though there seem to be some cause.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4520. Speak not injurious words neither in jest nor earnest;
scoff at none, although they give occasion.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4521. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first
to salute, hear, and answer; and be not pensive when it is a
time to converse.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4522. Detract not from others, neither be excessive in commending.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4523. If two contend together, take not the part of either
unconstrained, and be not obstinate in your own opinion; in
things indifferent, be of the major side.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4524. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly,
nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4525. When another speaks, be attentive yourself, and disturb
not the audience. If any hesitate in his words, help him
not, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him
not, nor answer him till his speech be ended.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4526. Make no comparisons; and if any of the company
be commended for any brave act of virtue, commend not another
for the same.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4527. Be not apt to relate news, if you know not the truth
thereof. In discoursing of things you have heard, name not
your author always. A secret discover not.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4528. Undertake not what you cannot perform, but be
careful to keep your promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4529. In disputes be not so desirous to overcome as not to
give liberty to each one to deliver his opinion, and submit to
the judgment of the major part, especially if they are judges
of the dispute.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4530. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4531. Be not angry at table, whatever happens; and if you
have reason to be so, show it not; put on a cheerful countenance,
especially if there be strangers, for good humor makes
one dish of meat a feast.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4532. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be
seriously in reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents,
although they be poor.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4533. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<p>4534. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark
of celestial fire called conscience.</p>

<p>4540. The four last denominations are used for dry goods
only. For liquids several denominations have been heretofore
adopted, viz.:&mdash;for Beer, the Firkin of 9 gallons, the Kilderkin,
of 18, the Barrel, of 36, the Hogshead, of 54, and the
Butt, of 108 gallons. These will probably continue to be used
in practice. For Wine and Spirits, there are the Anker,
Runlet, Tierce, Hogshead, Puncheon, Pipe, Butt, and Tun;
but these may be considered rather as the names of the casks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
in which such commodities are imported, than as expressing
any definite number of gallons. It is the practice to gauge
all such vessels, and to charge them according to their actual
content.</p>

<em>This is more, proportionately, than any periodical gives.</em> The Newspaper
